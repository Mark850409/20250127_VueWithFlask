第一口就是明顯的紅茶味，但茶湯在嘴裡游蕩的時候，其他的香氣就跳出來了。青茶的香氣和花香像是纏繞在一起，有時覺得它是青茶香，有時覺得它是花香。蜂蜜香較前兩個香氣淡，但還是分辨得出的。茶湯偏輕，微小的澀味可忽略不計。當做純茶喝的時候可以細細地品味茶湯本身的香氣，是有趣的茶，可以一試。",您給的指示語句為：請遵-follow-指示協助-do-中翻英：,1 年前,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,中性情感,7.616607287011481,e8842273c2f18d2ec9a995eb3bbc603a4da77b83855544e243387514b71a1829

2.搞錯訂單順序
比我晚來的都先拿到了
3.不夠貼心

#葡萄椰果冰萃
這款說真的我一開始喝以為是桑葚XD，口感不像赤心芭樂玉露凍，比較多的水果清香。底部的椰果有畫龍點睛之效，我覺得蠻特別的味道。這兩款比起來的話，我個人喜歡芭樂玉露凍的酸度，不過這款葡萄椰果真的很順口，一不注意就喝完了。

最後再說一下，由於台北手搖好像要開始禁用塑膠杯了，他們還有特別連名設計紙杯款，真的豪可愛。

我點了兩杯飲料，其中一杯是黑糖珍珠鮮奶。這杯飲品甜度本來就是固定的，但店員仍然詢問糖度需求，明顯對菜單內容不熟悉。雖然這點我可以理解為假日忙碌導致的疏忽，但接下來結帳時，我一開始就告知會使用Apple Pay，但店員完全沒有反應。直到要付款時，她才「笑嘻嘻」地告知Apple Pay無法使用，只能選擇Line Pay或現金。當下我立即開啟Line Pay條碼，但店員僅用口訴指示，態度不清不楚，最後甚至「不耐煩」地直接搶走我的手機處理。這樣的行為非常不尊重我。更令人不解的是，當時店內並沒有太多顧客，而對面其他飲料店雖然大排長龍，服務態度卻明顯優於貴店。另一位員工的動作也顯得拖拖拉拉，效率不佳，讓人懷疑貴店員工的專業訓練和情緒管理是否到位。

以下列點說明：
1. 中獎活動交接不明確，拿兌換券給店員的時候櫃檯的兩位店員都表示狐疑，後來進內場問了其他店員，討論了許久才知道如何兌換；另外，鑰匙圈店員表示沒貨無法給我換，我進一步有禮貌的請教應去哪家分店，店員卻沒好氣的叫我自己問其他分店，彷彿妥善規劃這個活動是我的責任
2. 飲料製作不專業，店員不清楚本次主打的美祿系列飲品製作方式，在裡面大聲討論如何製備，並在問我甜度冰塊時說明「恐龍美莓」這款飲料有「奶蓋」故只能做微冰無法去冰，我當然表示理解，但後來我聽到店員在竊竊私語表示原來沒有奶蓋⋯
而事實上我拿到的這款飲料確實沒有奶蓋
3. 杯體設計不良，因為另外有獲得兩個可可球加料，但外帶提把不夠高，根本很難拿之外，店員蓋子根本沒蓋好，膠帶也沒黏好，非常容易就分離⋯內容物掉出來。
再者，有可可球的加料，建議要有較高的杯蓋或湯匙供顧客選取（我願自費加購），而不是撕開封膜就難以收拾，必須馬上吃完，而且用粗吸管是無法食用的，除非等可可球泡軟溶解變小
4. 口感也可以說是不好喝。恐龍美莓是烏龍茶+美祿+草莓糖漿，茶味跟可可味極淡，但草莓香精味非常重；恐龍小白是美祿加蜂蜜白玉，喝起來就是超級稀的美祿加超軟的小顆麻糬，這個價位真的不如自己去買美祿泡。

10/27至貴店消費，朋友點了一杯有加茶厥的飲料，但實際拿到時發現店員忘了加。因為已離開附近，所以用Line跟店家反應，最後得到的回覆是：下次來店購買時會提供單杯免費加料。
不能理解為什麼是店家的疏失卻還要我們再度花錢遠道去消費才能拿回原本就該拿的東西？處理方式既沒誠意也不乾脆。
我們完全可以體諒因為忙碌而忘記，當下其實也不覺得生氣，但這並不代表我們的權益就要受損。
客訴處理的方式有很多種，直接跟客人要帳戶退費$15、或下次來店直接免費補償一杯這些都是很好的方式，但你們偏偏選擇最差勁的處理方式，你們確定請客人再次消費才能拿回補償是一個沒問題的致歉方式嗎？

霏等茶蕎麥茶拌麵台北通化店的服務真的是令人印象深刻。店內的員工不僅親切，還展現了無微不至的關懷，讓人感受到賓至如歸的氛圍。尤其是當我自備餐具時，詢問是否能借水清洗，店員不僅熱心幫忙清潔，還細心提供廚師紙巾讓我擦乾餐具，這種額外的貼心舉動讓人非常感動，完全超出我的預期。

這樣的服務，配上乾淨舒適的用餐環境，讓霏等茶成為一家讓人流連忘返的好店。不僅是餐點吸引人，更是以充滿溫度的服務贏得了顧客的心。

位於大安區的霏等茶蕎麥茶拌麵店採用半自助式用餐模式，餐具自取且不收服務費。從外觀看可能並不起眼，但一旦進店，就能感受到舒適的空間感，冷氣充足、落地窗帶來明亮開闊的感覺。經過店門口時，常被那撲鼻的蕎麥茶香吸引，這裡的乾拌麵更是令人驚艷。麵條Q彈、辣味適中，特別是搭配起司奶蓋，口感特殊的異國料理風味，可惜配料較為單調，僅有半顆蛋。

此外，推薦店家的飲品都很不錯，濃郁的口感和細膩的口感讓人回味無窮。有提供Line訂餐更方便快捷。蕎麥茶的風味接近日本，無糖版本特別清新解膩，回甘宜人。更值得一提的是，每道餐點都標示了熱量，對於飲食控制者非常友善，是通化夜市附近不錯的美食選擇。","The Q Line is an elevated train line in Chicago, Illinois, United States",4 個月前,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.42,正向情感,11.638095505849778,91a125cf142937ea12d9ac0f3ec9aff947d1beb1e443ed5257761feff8c95edd

茂谷柑醬的叉燒果豚拌麵，柑橘的風味讓人想到日本的 Afuri，越吃越開胃，兩片叉燒、半顆溏心蛋和青江菜，色香味俱全，不愛拌麵的我，默默被收服。

個人覺得很加分的是，霏等茶的茶品和麵食，每一項都有標示熱量，對於飲控者來說，可以輕鬆計算吃進去的熱量，很方便。

#葡萄椰果冰萃
這款說真的我一開始喝以為是桑葚XD，口感不像赤心芭樂玉露凍，比較多的水果清香。底部的椰果有畫龍點睛之效，我覺得蠻特別的味道。這兩款比起來的話，我個人喜歡芭樂玉露凍的酸度，不過這款葡萄椰果真的很順口，一不注意就喝完了。

最後再說一下，由於台北手搖好像要開始禁用塑膠杯了，他們還有特別連名設計紙杯款，真的豪可愛。

1. 中獎活動交接不明確，拿兌換券給店員的時候櫃檯的兩位店員都表示狐疑，後來進內場問了其他店員，討論了許久才知道如何兌換；另外，鑰匙圈店員表示沒貨無法給我換，我進一步有禮貌的請教應去哪家分店，店員卻沒好氣的叫我自己問其他分店，彷彿妥善規劃這個活動是我的責任
2. 飲料製作不專業，店員不清楚本次主打的美祿系列飲品製作方式，在裡面大聲討論如何製備，並在問我甜度冰塊時說明「恐龍美莓」這款飲料有「奶蓋」故只能做微冰無法去冰，我當然表示理解，但後來我聽到店員在竊竊私語表示原來沒有奶蓋⋯
而事實上我拿到的這款飲料確實沒有奶蓋
3. 杯體設計不良，因為另外有獲得兩個可可球加料，但外帶提把不夠高，根本很難拿之外，店員蓋子根本沒蓋好，膠帶也沒黏好，非常容易就分離⋯內容物掉出來。
再者，有可可球的加料，建議要有較高的杯蓋或湯匙供顧客選取（我願自費加購），而不是撕開封膜就難以收拾，必須馬上吃完，而且用粗吸管是無法食用的，除非等可可球泡軟溶解變小
4. 口感也可以說是不好喝。恐龍美莓是烏龍茶+美祿+草莓糖漿，茶味跟可可味極淡，但草莓香精味非常重；恐龍小白是美祿加蜂蜜白玉，喝起來就是超級稀的美祿加超軟的小顆麻糬，這個價位真的不如自己去買美祿泡。
對了可可球也沒什麼可可味跟甜味，口感像乖乖。","Plus one, plus two, and so on, until three, then double plus",1 週前,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,中性情感,10.990940995839821,4788b2b826d162e58a07c41f9e56606aa6cbdc4fe929b60a83af999069575bf4

10/27至貴店消費，朋友點了一杯有加茶厥的飲料，但實際拿到時發現店員忘了加。因為已離開附近，所以用Line跟店家反應，最後得到的回覆是：下次來店購買時會提供單杯免費加料。
不能理解為什麼是店家的疏失卻還要我們再度花錢遠道去消費才能拿回原本就該拿的東西？處理方式既沒誠意也不乾脆。
我們完全可以體諒因為忙碌而忘記，當下其實也不覺得生氣，但這並不代表我們的權益就要受損。
客訴處理的方式有很多種，直接跟客人要帳戶退費$15、或下次來店直接免費補償一杯這些都是很好的方式，但你們偏偏選擇最差勁的處理方式，你們確定請客人再次消費才能拿回補償是一個沒問題的致歉方式嗎？
這杯飲料共計$80價格不低，我怎麼感覺我們花錢找受罪？

(Title of the poem)

The moon in love's brightness dwells,
And I in darkness; it's a tale
Told by an idle wind to sails.

Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no! It is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;

It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's a constant mind at any rate,
Though all external things should change.

I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.

I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

I love thee with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life! And if God choose,

2024/5月起第一間門市在台北內湖，第二間在信義區永吉路30巷內，
目前永吉店2024/10月底試營運，將在11月正式開幕；
因為是Fred開的，來試試喝喝看。

店員主推「法國奶霜系列」
因此買來「開心果奶霜(M:$60)」
奶霜非常開心果，非常甜，因此建議搭配無糖茶；如果喜歡奶霜系列的朋友，很值得來試試：）

2024/10/29消費，還在試營運階段，因此尚無行動支付，只有現金唷，店員表示正式開幕後(大約11月中）才有電子支付～","""WTF"" stands for ""What the feast!"", which is a new brand opened by Fred.
The first store will be opened in Taipei, Neihu starting from May 2024, and the second one in Xinyi district, Yongji Street 30 Alley, with the Neihu store starting trial operation on October 31, 2024, and officially opening in November.
Since it's Fred's shop, come and try some drinks.

The staff mainly recommends the ""French Cream Series"".
Therefore, I bought the ""Happiness Custard Cream (M: $60)"".
The cream is very custard-like and sweet, so it's recommended to pair with sugar-free tea; if you like the cream series, it's definitely worth trying. 🙂

Since it's still in the trial operation stage on October 29, 2024, there is no mobile payment yet, only cash.

我點了兩杯飲料，其中一杯是黑糖珍珠鮮奶。這杯飲品甜度本來就是固定的，但店員仍然詢問糖度需求，明顯對菜單內容不熟悉。雖然這點我可以理解為假日忙碌導致的疏忽，但接下來結帳時，我一開始就告知會使用Apple Pay，但店員完全沒有反應。直到要付款時，她才「笑嘻嘻」地告知Apple Pay無法使用，只能選擇Line Pay或現金。當下我立即開啟Line Pay條碼，但店員僅用口訴指示，態度不清不楚，最後甚至「不耐煩」地直接搶走我的手機處理。這樣的行為非常不尊重我。更令人不解的是，當時店內並沒有太多顧客，而對面其他飲料店雖然大排長龍，服務態度卻明顯優於貴店。另一位員工的動作也顯得拖拖拉拉，效率不佳，讓人懷疑貴店員工的專業訓練和情緒管理是否到位。

貴店飲品定價不低，顧客自然期待對等的服務品質。","Today's purchasing experience made me very unhappy, I would like to express this ^_^
I clicked on two drinks, one of which was brown sugar pearl fresh milk. The sweetness of the drink was already fixed, but the employee still inquired about the sugar level, clearly not familiar with the menu content. Although I can understand that it might be due to being busy during holidays, the employee's reaction to Apple Pay was completely absent. It wasn't until it was time to pay that she said ""ha-ha"" and told me that Apple Pay could not be used, only Line Pay or cash. At that moment, I immediately opened Line Pay QR code, but the employee just gave verbal instructions with an unclear and impatient attitude, even grabbing my phone hurriedly to handle it herself. Such behavior is very disrespectful. Moreover, at that time, there weren't many customers in the store, while the other beverage stores nearby had long lines, yet their service was obviously better.

第一口就是明顯的紅茶味，但茶湯在嘴裡游蕩的時候，其他的香氣就跳出來了。青茶的香氣和花香像是纏繞在一起，有時覺得它是青茶香，有時覺得它是花香。蜂蜜香較前兩個香氣淡，但還是分辨得出的。茶湯偏輕，微小的澀味可忽略不計。當做純茶喝的時候可以細細地品味茶湯本身的香氣，是有趣的茶，可以一試。","Today I don't feel like having pearls, so I was looking for a shop with great oolong tea. Eventually, I chose the Golden Monkey Red Tea, wondering what it would taste like (although it might not actually be golden monkey tea, but just oolong leaves that have fermented into red tea; but, no mistakes please). As usual, it was warm, with a little sugar.

The first sip was clearly of red tea, but as the soup lingered in my mouth, other aromas emerged. The scent of green tea and floral notes seemed to be entwined together, sometimes I thought it was green tea fragrance, sometimes I thought it was floral.

25,山焙(忠孝敦化店),Polly Chou,1,"抽中美祿系列飲品+鑰匙圈，沒指定門市所以就去附近的這家，但真心覺得人員教育訓練需要加強，飲品美味度也是
以下列點說明：
1. 中獎活動交接不明確，拿兌換券給店員的時候櫃檯的兩位店員都表示狐疑，後來進內場問了其他店員，討論了許久才知道如何兌換；另外，鑰匙圈店員表示沒貨無法給我換，我進一步有禮貌的請教應去哪家分店，店員卻沒好氣的叫我自己問其他分店，彷彿妥善規劃這個活動是我的責任
2. 飲料製作不專業，店員不清楚本次主打的美祿系列飲品製作方式，在裡面大聲討論如何製備，並在問我甜度冰塊時說明「恐龍美莓」這款飲料有「奶蓋」故只能做微冰無法去冰，我當然表示理解，但後來我聽到店員在竊竊私語表示原來沒有奶蓋⋯
而事實上我拿到的這款飲料確實沒有奶蓋
3. 杯體設計不良，因為另外有獲得兩個可可球加料，但外帶提把不夠高，根本很難拿之外，店員蓋子根本沒蓋好，膠帶也沒黏好，非常容易就分離⋯內容物掉出來。
再者，有可可球的加料，建議要有較高的杯蓋或湯匙供顧客選取（我願自費加購），而不是撕開封膜就難以收拾，必須馬上吃完，而且用粗吸管是無法食用的，除非等可可球泡軟溶解變小
4. 口感也可以說是不好喝。恐龍美莓是烏龍茶+美祿+草莓糖漿，茶味跟可可味極淡，但草莓香精味非常重；恐龍小白是美祿加蜂蜜白玉，喝起來就是超級稀的美祿加超軟的小顆麻糬，這個價位真的不如自己去買美祿泡。
對了可可球也沒什麼可可味跟甜味，口感像乖乖。","1. The rules for the lottery activity were not clear, and when I presented the exchange coupons to the cashier, both employees seemed uncertain. After asking other staff members about the redemption process, it took a long time to figure out how to redeem the prize; in addition, the keychain staff said they had no stock, but when I politely asked where I could exchange it, the employee called me to ask myself instead of suggesting another branch.
2. The preparation of the drink was not professional, and the staff were unsure about the production method for the Luckysuper Series drinks. They discussed loudly how to prepare it and mentioned that the ""T-Rex Berry"" drink did not have whipped cream, so it could only be made with crushed ice, which I understood but later found out from their hushed conversation that there was no whipped cream in the drink I received.
3. The cup design was flawed because, although I also won two scoops of KitKat as an add-on, the handle didn't extend high enough, making it difficult to pick up. The lid wasn't properly sealed, and the seal strip wasn't sticky, so it easily came apart. Content fell out. Furthermore, since there were scoops of KitKat as an add-on, I suggested having a taller cup lid or ladle for customers (I was willing to pay extra), but instead, the cover had to be torn off immediately and was difficult to clean up, leaving me no choice but to eat it all at once, which couldn't be done with a coarse straw unless the KitKat dissolved in the drink.
4. The taste was also not enjoyable. The T-Rex Berry was made of black tea + Luckysuper + raspberry syrup, but the tea flavor was very subtle compared to the strong berry aroma; the T-Rex White was Luckysuper with honey white jelly, which tasted extremely watery and had a very soft texture of tiny rice puffs, which wasn't worth the price.

10/27至貴店消費，朋友點了一杯有加茶厥的飲料，但實際拿到時發現店員忘了加。因為已離開附近，所以用Line跟店家反應，最後得到的回覆是：下次來店購買時會提供單杯免費加料。
不能理解為什麼是店家的疏失卻還要我們再度花錢遠道去消費才能拿回原本就該拿的東西？處理方式既沒誠意也不乾脆。
我們完全可以體諒因為忙碌而忘記，當下其實也不覺得生氣，但這並不代表我們的權益就要受損。
客訴處理的方式有很多種，直接跟客人要帳戶退費$15、或下次來店直接免費補償一杯這些都是很好的方式，但你們偏偏選擇最差勁的處理方式，你們確定請客人再次消費才能拿回補償是一個沒問題的致歉方式嗎？
這杯飲料共計$80價格不低，我怎麼感覺我們花錢找受罪？

There are many ways to handle complaints, such as directly refunding the account $15 or providing free compensation for a drink when you come to shop next time, or even waiving the cost of the forgotten item, all of which would be good methods. However, you chose the worst possible handling method. Are you sure that requiring customers to return and consume again in order to receive compensation is an acceptable way of apologizing? This beverage costs $80, which is not a low price. I feel like we are paying for suffering. If you want to continue long-term operation, I strongly recommend the owner to strengthen employee training on customer complaint handling, otherwise your store's current handling method really makes people hesitant to return.",3 個月前,0.14,0.11,0.74,0.86,正向情感,9.178856336388414,655aecfa0a091013ccd4720f63af6dd5a7ac8a79534b343b7165995075fc902d

#Lord Buddha
It tastes great 👍 The sweetness can't be adjusted, but I think the ratio is perfect... It has a subtle fragrance of Lord Buddha that is elegant and refreshing. Highly recommended!!!!!
#Black Sugar Pearl Thick Milk Tea 30% sugar/light ice/large
My school sister said she always drinks this drink at 85 degrees C 🤣🤣🤣

#Bourgeois Bear
Apart from the chocolate decorations on the bear's ears, eyes, and nose, it is similar to Boston cream (￣▽￣)
#Boston Cream
The below is a soft, fluffy Boston cake with a filling of custard inside and a dense, rich, and aromatic layer of fresh cream on top, sprinkled with cocoa powder.

Actually, both are Boston cream... but the bear-shaped one is particularly special!
85 degrees C's pastries look so cute and neat. I really miss them. It has been too long since I last enjoyed a cheap pastry 🥰

第一次遇到喝飲料吸管插不到底，本來應該逐漸融合的芒果冰淇淋跟青茶，硬生生變成青茶加上芒果冰塊，底下硬邦邦，是要人怎麼喝= =

回去跟店員反應，還理直氣壯要我等底下那個大冰塊融化，杯子外面都結霜了，請問是要我等多久才能喝到一杯正常芒果青？

可以體諒客人很多，想先把料備起來，但那一整坨在底下，是要我把青茶喝完再挖冰淇淋來吃哦（更何況那個已經不能稱作是芒果冰淇淋了，應該改叫做芒果口味大冰塊）

The first time I tried to drink through the straw, it wouldn't go all the way down. The shaved ice and green tea, which were supposed to blend gradually, turned into green tea with chunks of mango shaved ice at the bottom, making it difficult to drink.

Upon complaining to the staff, they suggested I wait for the bottom block of ice to melt, but the cup was already frosty on the outside and I asked how long it would take before I could get a normal mango green tea.

They empathized with many customers who wanted to have their orders ready, but that large block of ice at the bottom meant I had to finish the green tea first before getting the shaved ice. (Notably, it's no longer mango shaved ice by then, it should be called a large mango-flavored ice block.)

Additionally, the cup was broken and had many scratches, making me feel uneasy.

From the counter, I don't understand why shaking one cup takes three minutes, not to mention during peak hours like lunch, it's unclear why it needs to be faster. I've worked in a beverage shop before, and at most, it took me 1.5 minutes to shake a cup.

2. The order was mixed up
Everyone who came after me got their orders first
3. Lack of Attention
I waited for about 10 minutes, finally got my drink ready and sealed, but the server didn't immediately put it on the counter, instead she let it continue in the sealing machine and handled other orders, extending my waiting time again. She only gave me my drink after she finished taking care of customers and finishing their orders, the issue is that the server still had not completed her other orders when I received my drink.

Perhaps that girl is new, I can tolerate the drinks being slow, but at least in small details, try to be more caring, otherwise it's easy for customers to overheat under such weather conditions. The counter girl and backstage supply person are great, they work quickly without rushing, they know what to do, there's nothing to complain about.

The first store will open in Taipei, Neihu from May 2024, and the second store will be in Yongji Street, 30 Alley in Xinyi District. The Nehji store started trial operation on October 31st, 2024, and it will officially open in November.

Since it is opened by Fred, come and give it a try.

The staff recommends the ""Happy Goat Cheese (M:$60)"" from the French yogurt series. The yogurt is very creamy and sweet, so it is suggested to pair it with unsweetened tea. If you enjoy the yogurt series, it's definitely worth a try.

On October 29th, 2024, the store is still in the trial operation stage, so there is no mobile payment available at the moment, only cash transactions. The staff mentioned that electronic payment will be available after official opening (approximately November).",0.11,0.02,0.88,0.93,正向情感,7.15,938c98108c52e7cd4410baacb96cb74e77f0e23b2829a0b19bb72e1c83bc9a85

Firstly, the strawberry flavor does not resemble the original, nor can you taste individual strawberry seeds; the thick sweet-sour taste is strange. The red beans are also uncooked and hard, with a bad texture. The glutinous rice balls are still OK, but the quantity is small and they float on the surface, difficult to suck at first, and the glutinous rice balls have a poor texture because they are not in grain-like form but rather a whole piece that is sucked up, with a poor texture. Lastly, the sweetness is too high, about half as sweet as sugar, I'm not sure if it is strawberry syrup sweetness, this price of 100 yuan really needs to be improved, it's not just mixing everything together and selling it as a creative new drink!

25,山焙(忠孝敦化店),Polly Chou,1,"抽中美祿系列飲品+鑰匙圈，沒指定門市所以就去附近的這家，但真心覺得人員教育訓練需要加強，飲品美味度也是
以下列點說明：
1. 中獎活動交接不明確，拿兌換券給店員的時候櫃檯的兩位店員都表示狐疑，後來進內場問了其他店員，討論了許久才知道如何兌換；另外，鑰匙圈店員表示沒貨無法給我換，我進一步有禮貌的請教應去哪家分店，店員卻沒好氣的叫我自己問其他分店，彷彿妥善規劃這個活動是我的責任
2. 飲料製作不專業，店員不清楚本次主打的美祿系列飲品製作方式，在裡面大聲討論如何製備，並在問我甜度冰塊時說明「恐龍美莓」這款飲料有「奶蓋」故只能做微冰無法去冰，我當然表示理解，但後來我聽到店員在竊竊私語表示原來沒有奶蓋⋯
而事實上我拿到的這款飲料確實沒有奶蓋
3. 杯體設計不良，因為另外有獲得兩個可可球加料，但外帶提把不夠高，根本很難拿之外，店員蓋子根本沒蓋好，膠帶也沒黏好，非常容易就分離⋯內容物掉出來。
再者，有可可球的加料，建議要有較高的杯蓋或湯匙供顧客選取（我願自費加購），而不是撕開封膜就難以收拾，必須馬上吃完，而且用粗吸管是無法食用的，除非等可可球泡軟溶解變小
4. 口感也可以說是不好喝。恐龍美莓是烏龍茶+美祿+草莓糖漿，茶味跟可可味極淡，但草莓香精味非常重；恐龍小白是美祿加蜂蜜白玉，喝起來就是超級稀的美祿加超軟的小顆麻糬，這個價位真的不如自己去買美祿泡。
對了可可球也沒什麼可可味跟甜味，口感像乖乖。",1 週前,"1. The rules of the lottery activity were unclear, and when I presented the exchange voucher to the cashier, both employees seemed uncertain. Later, after asking other staff members inside, it took a long discussion to find out how to redeem it. Additionally, the key ring staff member said they had no stock to exchange for me, and when I politely asked where else to get it, the employee seemed irritated and told me to ask another store instead. It seemed as if planning this activity was my responsibility.
2. The preparation of the drink was unprofessional, and the staff were not clear about the production method of the Lucky Series drinks. They discussed loudly how to prepare it, and when they asked about the sweetness and ice cubes for the ""T-Rex Mixed Berries"" drink, they mentioned that this drink has a ""cream top"" so it can only be made with minimal ice, which I understood but later learned from their hushed whispers that there was no cream top...and indeed the drink I received had no cream top.
3. The cup design was flawed because although I received two extra kernel balls as toppings, the handle was not high enough, making it very difficult to pick up. The lid was not properly sealed and the seal strip was not sticky, so it easily separated...the contents could fall out. Furthermore, the kernel ball topping, which is recommended, should have a higher cup cover or ladle provided for customers to choose (I was willing to pay extra), instead of having to tear open the seal wrap and then unable to clean up, forcing me to drink it immediately before it gets messy, and moreover, the coarse straw was not suitable for consumption unless the kernel balls softened and dissolved.
4. The taste was also unpleasant. The ""T-Rex Mixed Berries"" is black tea + Lucky + raspberry syrup, but the black tea flavor was very subtle, while the raspberry flavor was very strong; the ""Little White T-Rex"" is Lucky with honey white jade, and when drank it was extremely diluted Lucky with soft little grains of tapioca, this price does not compare to buying Lucky tea balls myself.

10/27至貴店消費，朋友點了一杯有加茶厥的飲料，但實際拿到時發現店員忘了加。因為已離開附近，所以用Line跟店家反應，最後得到的回覆是：下次來店購買時會提供單杯免費加料。

客訴處理的方式有很多種，直接跟客人要帳戶退費$15、或下次來店直接免費補償一杯這些都是很好的方式，但你們偏偏選擇最差勁的處理方式，你們確定請客人再次消費才能拿回補償是一個沒問題的致歉方式嗎？

44,麥吉machi machi(台北大安店),Yen-Po Chang,3,"2024/11月週五下午18：00前來，看起來很有名，有賣周邊商品，陸續有人在買不過不用排隊。
麥吉水果四季春$80，無糖少冰，本來點茉香綠茶但沒有茉莉綠茶了換成四季春。點了之後約5分鐘取貨，很特別的是水果茶內附小牙籤，店員提醒可以用牙籤來吃裡面的水果，菜單上寫有草莓芭樂蘋果香吉士百香果檸檬，實際確實有芭樂一片，檸檬一片，蘋果一片，香吉士三片，百香果子若干，草莓1/4顆。
優點：確實有水果沒錯，而且除了草莓有點賣相不佳其他品質尚可。
缺點：
1.冰塊只有去冰跟少冰兩種，不像一般店可能有五種檔次，但點了少冰後打開整杯有半杯是冰，飲料三分鐘喝完後冰根本還沒融化，用那根小牙籤要戳到壓在下面的水果很困難，要不冰少一點要不牙籤長一點才有實用性。
2. 青茶其實沒什麼濃烈的茶味，水果除了百香果外也不會立刻入味，所以整杯雖然算有誠意但味道很淡，看起來菜單上那些果汁+茶的品項會更有吸引力。

烤布蕾紅茶拿鐵$85：選擇無糖，上面飄著一顆烤布蕾，下面是紅茶+牛奶。
優點：烤布蕾確實非常好吃，外面一顆就能賣50~60的程度，不過如果點去冰上面就不能放焦糖所以還是要點那個冰很多的少冰，不知道什麼概念..
缺點：把烤布蕾壓下去後，與紅茶一起喝效果不是很好，首先紅茶沒什麼苦味或是特別濃烈的香味，喝起來只是沖淡了布蕾的香甜，並且作為一種配料，比一般布丁難吸不少，茶喝完後會剩下在下面比較可惜，如果作為單獨的甜點感覺會更願意買。
整體而言，這次點的兩個招牌都沒有想像中好，而且也偏貴，可能要選別的招牌品項更好。",2 個月前,"2024/November/Thursday afternoon before 6:00 PM, a well-known vendor selling surrounding goods was expected. People were buying without having to queue in turns.
Ma Ji Fruit Four Seasons Spring $80, sugar-free and ice-less, originally ordered Mocha Green Tea but there was no Jasmine Green Tea so it was changed to Four Seasons Spring. After ordering, the goods were ready in about 5 minutes, interestingly enough, the fruit tea comes with small toothpicks, the staff informed that they can be used to eat the fruit inside, according to the menu it contains strawberries, watermelon, apples, kiwi slices, pineapple, and various durian pieces. In reality, there were indeed strawberries, a slice of lemon, an apple slice, three kiwi slices, several durian pieces, and one fourth of a strawberry.
Pros: The fruit was indeed available as promised, and aside from the strawberry, the quality of the other items was acceptable.
Cons:
1. Only ""go ice"" and ""less ice"" options were available for the ice, unlike most stores with five levels of ice cubes. After ordering ""less ice,"" the entire cup contained half ice, which lasted three minutes after drinking it, making it difficult to use the small toothpick to poke into the fruit at the bottom, either reduce the amount of ice or make the toothpick longer for practicality.
2. The green tea actually had little strong tea flavor, and the fruits (except durian) did not immediately absorb the flavor, so although the entire cup was intended to have sincerity, the taste was weak, items with fruit juices+tea on the menu would be more attractive.

Iron Pot Red Tea & Bun $85: Chose sugar-free, a bun floats on top with red tea and milk below.
Pros: The roasted taro bun is indeed very delicious, one piece can sell for 50 to 60 yuan, but if you choose ""go ice"" on the surface, it cannot be sprinkled with sugar so it is still necessary to choose a lot of ""less ice,"" I'm not sure what principle...
Cons: After pressing down the roasted taro bun, its flavor is not very good when combined with red tea, firstly, the red tea does not have much bitterness or intense aroma, drinking it only mutes the sweetness of the bun, and as a topping, it is less attractive compared to general cream puffs. Additionally, after drinking the tea, there will be a slightly unfortunate residue left at the bottom, if served as a separate dessert, it would be more attractive to buy.
Overall, neither of the featured items met expectations this time and were somewhat expensive, possibly choosing other menu items would be better.",0.11,0.04,0.85,0.99,正向情感,11.83,fdbd256f0ff37289487045a8760da96f7a0f7bc6aa6f6ca7f121846342921d7e

65,917 好事咖啡創意廚房,Singer 蕭,5,"一次無意中造訪的店，餐點美味，而且吃的出對食材料理的堅持。用餐空間大，環境氛圍也不錯，是一間值得再回訪的餐廳。目前已經5訪，點了許多餐點，各式餐點真的都不錯吃，無雷。一般外面的餐廳強項可能在某幾項餐點，有些品項會不好吃，但這家餐廳厲害的是每項餐點(義大利麵、米食、帕里尼、披薩、炸物)都在水準之上，所以比較建議多人分食，可以吃到不同種餐點。

目前吃過的餐點有：
義大利麵：白醬明太子義大利麵，香煎腿排青醬義大利麵。
一般外面餐廳的義大利麵醬汁會湯湯水水的，但這家餐廳的醬汁很濃郁，且完整的包覆在麵條上，口感與美味兼具。

米食：紅酒燉牛肉燉飯、匈牙利鮮蔬燻牛炒飯。
不是台式的料理做法，偏向融合歐式及日式的料理手法，飯粒軟硬適中，美味。

帕里尼Panini：歐姆辣牛肉帕尼尼、天然羅勒雞肉帕尼尼。
吃過一些外面餐廳歐式帕里尼，壓熱的吐司太硬，但這家比較是我喜歡偏日式的作法，吐司軟硬適中，也是滿推的。若多人分食可事先給店家說需要先切好的份數。

披薩：米蘭有隻雞披薩、印度咖哩跑路雞披薩、德國有隻狗披薩。
薄片型的披薩，比較不油膩，而且起司給得滿多的，會牽絲。

炸物：薯條。
外層香酥，內層鬆軟，炸功有水準。建議可以增加松露薯條的品項，會更好吃。

甜點：巧克力花生蛋糕、香蕉巧克力鬆餅、巧克力香蕉法式吐司。
有一般甜點店的水準。

飲料：香蕉蘋果果昔、甜橙奇異果果昔、澄酒拿鐵、綠茶歐蕾。
雖然口味不重，但用料天然好喝。點飯食、麵食，飲料可半價。",6 個月前,"Once by accident, I visited a restaurant with delicious food, and they were very particular about the ingredients. The dining space is large, and the environment is not bad either, making it a restaurant worth revisiting. I have been there 5 times and tried many dishes, and all of them are really good. Generally, street food restaurants may excel in some dishes, but some items may not taste good, but this restaurant stands out because every dish (Italian pasta, rice dishes, Parma ham, pizza, fried foods) is above average, so it is recommended to have more people share the food to try different dishes.

Currently, I have tried the following dishes:
- Italian pasta: white sauce with meatballs Italian pasta, sautéed ham and parmesan cheese Italian pasta.
The sauce in most street food restaurants' Italian pasta is watery, but this restaurant's sauce is thick and well-coated on the pasta noodles, with a good texture and flavor.
- Rice dishes: Hungarian red wine braised beef rice bowl, fresh vegetable stir-fried Hungarian rice bowl.
Not Taiwanese cuisine, but they have a European and Japanese style of cooking, the rice grains are soft and tender, and it tastes delicious.
- Panini: spicy omega beef panini, natural chicken breast panini.
I've tried some Western-style paninis from other restaurants, and the bread is too hard, but this one is closer to my preference for a more Japanese style of making paninis, with soft and tender bread. If you are ordering it for multiple people, please let the restaurant know in advance so they can cut the portions accordingly.
- Pizza: chicken Milanese pizza, Indian curry chicken pizza, German sausage pizza.
Thin crust pizza, not too oily, and there is plenty of cheese on top, which makes it tasty.
- Fried foods: French fries.
The outside layer is crispy, and the inside layer is soft and well-fried. I recommend adding sweet potato fries to the menu as it would taste better.
- Desserts: chocolate almond cake, banana chocolate soufflé pancake, chocolate banana French toast.
It has the same level of quality as regular dessert shops.
- Beverages: pineapple banana smoothie, exotic fruit smoothie, iced tea earl grey, green tea matcha.

Recently, I'm trying to lose weight, so no milk tea or shaved ice. Instead, try [""Tian Rin Tea""](https://www.tian-rin.com/), and have a sip of 918Tea King.

☑ 913Tea King 💰60 = Unsweetened with a hint of coolness. The entry is smooth, the Oolong tea flavor is not bad, with the unique floral aroma of Oolong tea, aftertaste starts to have a slight roasted flavor note, which covers the original fruit aroma of Oolong tea, as I looked it up, 913Tea King turns out to be a blend tea that infuses American milk oolong, that explains it. The aftertaste is clean and dry, cannot perceive any astringency even without sugar, my mouth feels slightly sweet aftertaste, not bad, 5 out of 5.

.
從一開始發現的巷弄小舖
想說為何只開一扇窗就做起飲料生意
一口喝就知道不是茶精泡的茶
老闆每杯親手泡，熱心解釋，還拿茶葉渣說「這些都是真的」
我不想聽，我只想喝
好啦! 是真的好茶，就算放到常溫無糖還是一樣好茶
天然的回甘，就像在樹下的涼風，吹再多都覺得舒服，一點也不造假
.
然後好啦~ 養壞我的嘴
再給我從從南港搬到大安
是要我在南港喝什麼?! 是給我說說
趁假日一早專程跑去買
就告訴自己是有多愛，追星?!
還給我出早餐
到底是在賣飲料還是怎樣
早餐的鹹甜食都天殺的好吃
不經懷疑，到底有沒有在用心做飲料?
是要把早餐做得好吃又不貴
.
以下是本人和同行友人實吃實喝經驗

．奶酥厚片
奶香、酥集於一片上，沒有再多評語，只想告訴老闆，可以設座位在店門口，讓我吃完再走嗎?

．熱壓蔥蛋牛肉堡、鹹香蔥蛋牛肉堡
牛肉多汁，起司和蔥蛋的鹹香混合在一起，有點台又有點西，算是蹦出新滋味? FB還有刊再加一份蛋會下巴脫臼，是否也太誇張了吧
唯一不誇張的是，真的是用料好又實在，超好吃!早餐吃完應該也不用吃午餐了（小資減肥新生活?）

．鐵觀音無糖去冰
濃厚茶香茶味，老闆是要多下重本，茶味十足，口甘不用說，像是用茶具泡出來的好茶
覺得買個幾杯回家冰著屯貨都可以

．檸香凍頂微糖+冬瓜檸檬凍
冬瓜檸檬凍說實在有點硬耶
但就這樣放著放著，一段時間後，居然變軟變得像果凍一樣
味道進了茶中，又喝得到較軟的凍，頓時從60分升到100分
自此這杯是我的最愛飲料組合

．啵啵燕麥
有次在南港上班前問老闆，告訴他我還沒吃飯，但我等等沒時間吃
建議一杯讓我飽到下班的飲料組合
居然叫我奶茶加上「啵啵燕麥」
想說為何要喝這個糊糊的東西
沒想到吸管一吸! 這也太誇張了吧
是一粒粒的燕麥QQ的爆開在嘴裡
說爆開有點誇張，是一種很奇妙的口感
這口感是第一次在飲料店喝到的
最後真的這一杯讓我撐過6小時不餓，而且又好喝
.
最後要敲碗
請回來南港.....",2 年前,"This shop is truly not pretentious.
From the start, discovering its alleyway small shop, I wondered why it only opened one window to start a beverage business. One sip told me that it wasn't matcha powder tea. The owner personally brews each cup with sincerity, even explaining and showing the tea leaves leftover, saying ""These are all real."" I didn't want to listen, I just wanted to drink. Alright! It is truly good tea, even without sugar or served at room temperature, it remains good.
Natural sweetness, like a cool breeze under a tree, feels even more comfortable with each gust. Not fake in any way.

Then, well~ spoil me even more by moving from North District to Daan. What am I supposed to drink in North District?! Are you trying to tell me something? Running early during holidays to buy, telling myself how much I love it, stalking... and they also served breakfast. Is this shop selling food or what?
Breakfast foods were heavenly delicious. No doubt, they put effort into making the beverages? They made the breakfast delicious yet not expensive.

Here are personal and friends' real-life experience with the drinks:

-. Milk Foam Cake
Rich milk and pastry flavor all in one slice, no need for more description, just telling the owner if they could set a table by the shop door so I can eat and leave?

-. Pressed Scallion Egg Pork Burger, Spicy Scallion Egg Pork Burger
The pork has plenty of juice, mixed with onions and eggs that create a salty-spicy flavor. It's a bit Taiwanese and a bit Western, creating a new taste sensation? Facebook also has an additional egg which makes your jaw drop, is it too boastful?
Only thing not boastful is, the ingredients are genuinely good and real, extremely delicious! After eating breakfast, you may not need lunch anymore (losing weight with the new lifestyle?)

-. Iron Goddess Oolong Unsweetened Iced Tea
Rich tea aroma and flavor, the owner insists on brewing it properly, the tea flavor is strong, taste buds are delighted without a doubt, as if it was made using teaware. Worth buying several cups to store at home.

-. Osmanthus Sorbet with Honey Dew Melon Sorbet + Winter Melon Osmanthus Sorbet
Winter Melon Osmanthus Sorbet is a bit hard, I have to admit. However, just leaving it for some time, surprisingly, it becomes soft like ice cream. The flavor seeped into the tea, making the sorbet softer and more enjoyable. From 60 points, it went up to 100 points instantly. Since then, this combination is my favorite beverage.

-. Sesame Mochi
One time before work in North District, I asked the owner if they had any suggestions for breakfast as I hadn't eaten yet but had no time. To my surprise, he suggested a milk tea with ""Sesame Mochi."" I wondered why I should drink such sticky stuff. Surprisingly, it was like popping sesame seeds in my mouth. The sensation was extraordinary, a new feeling I haven't experienced in any beverage shop. In the end, this one cup kept me full for 6 hours without needing lunch and it was delicious to drink as well.

Finally, ask for more:

The number of cups in front of you, approximately 3-5, suggests that the next order was mine, but I waited for a total of 15 minutes, which felt too long... Given my previous experience working at a beverage shop, I can understand that the delay may not have been due to the number of orders, but rather an emergency situation in the store.

However, my complaint is that the items received are different from what was ordered! The blue eco cup should contain warm Osmanthus Sweet Potato Red Tea with Fresh Milk, but what was delivered was cold and even had an additional fee for heating (5 yuan), the milk tea-colored eco cup should have contained Osmanthus Jasmine Fresh Milk, but it contained Osmanthus Sweet Potato Red Tea with Fresh Milk... Fortunately, it was for family to drink. If it were for a friend, it would be quite awkward?
The reasons given above may result in one star being deducted, but the service aspect still has potential, even mentioning that the sweet potato bun was insufficient and whether tapioca pearls could be used as a substitute, which I hope can be maintained.

76,湊湊火鍋.茶憩(Garden City大巨蛋店),Karen Wang,3,"友人邀約前來體驗位於大巨蛋內的湊湊火鍋，一進門帶位的服務人員就將我們帶錯了包廂🙄

一進包廂就發現這個包廂非常的小還要坐10個人，果然開始用餐之後就發現了，這設計非常的有問題送餐的服務人員將餐點放在電視下方的餐台上，但是坐在裡面的我們根本就沒辦法前去取用食材。桌子非常的狹小，所以坐在最外面的朋友就要非常辛苦的協助大家拿菜放入火鍋內。 且一次送來非常多的餐點放在外面又不好拿，所以食材容易變的不新鮮。

入座後不到5分鐘朋友都還沒有到齊，服務人員進來建議請我們先點餐，因為餐點要煮2-30分鐘才會熱，有詢問不能煮開再送進來嗎？結果回覆是不行因為很重不方便。

我們是包廂有低消11,000且飲料不能折抵消費。所以建議我們點八人餐後面可以再加點喜歡的食材。包廂是用賓士鍋可以選三種湯底，其中一個是成都老麻火鍋，另外一個建議我們點胡椒豬肚雞鍋，我們另外一個想點菌菇鍋，結果服務人員說煮久了會變鹹，建議我們點蕃茄牛膝骨鍋。

好不容易餐點上來了開始煮，結果發現湯底的口味通通很普通一點都沒有特色，老麻鍋也不麻也不辣更不香，豬肚鍋完全的沒有胡椒味，店員推薦的蕃茄鍋大家通通都不喜歡，丟下去的食材都沒人要吃。最後還是把它撈到麻辣鍋裡面才有人吃。

但必須說這裡的食材是很優秀的，可是湯底的味道非常的不及格。浪費了新鮮的海鮮和肉。

且這裡的服務非常的不好，員工訓練有問題我們有自帶酒請他提供冰桶，但是冰桶就放在桌上，沒有放在冰桶架上，冰桶外面的水後來留了滿桌子。

雖然包廂內有設置服務鈴，但都要按了兩三次，過了好幾分鐘才會有人前來服務。

這家餐廳訴求是吃火鍋可以唱歌，但是包廂內的音響效果非常的不好，麥克風聲音很小，整體的唱歌效果很差，且不會像KTV一樣有字幕的提示。你要自己知道要如何唱，所以如果是想要邊吃飯邊唱歌的話，還是建議你到火鍋店吃完再去KTV。

噢對了，還有一個非常奇葩的地方，醬料自助吧，每人要收35元，因為是點8人的套餐，所以有含這費用，不懂到一個消費不便宜的火鍋店，連醬料都還要收取費用？醬料吧除了醬料之外，有提供白飯 三樣小菜（泡菜、杏鮑菇跟百香果醃漬的瓜）水果有西瓜與鳳梨。

還有因為餐廳是位於大巨蛋，所以廁所是在外面當天下雨還要淋雨去外面上廁所非常的不方便。

總之這是一家來過一次就不會再想回訪的餐廳。",2 個月前,"A friend invited me to experience a hot pot at The Egg inside the Big Goose, but the service staff accidentally led us to the wrong room 🙄. Upon entering the small room, which only seats ten people, I found that it was extremely small and uncomfortable. The service staff placed our food on a table in front of the TV, but we couldn't reach it from where we were sitting. The tables were very narrow, so my friends had to assist everyone in getting the food and placing it in the hot pot. The food arrived in large quantities and was difficult to handle outside, causing the food to become less fresh.

  Before five minutes had passed, none of our friends had arrived yet. The service staff suggested that we order first because the dishes take 2-30 minutes to cook and cannot be reheated and served again due to being too heavy to carry. Unfortunately, this was not an option.

   We were seated in a booth with a low discount of 11,000 Yuan, but drinks could not be used to offset the cost. They suggested we order an eight-person meal and then add more items if desired. The restaurant uses enameled cast iron pots, and there are three broth choices, one of which is Chengdu Mala Hot Pot, another recommended was Sichuan Peppercorn Chicken Hot Pot, and we also wanted to order Mushroom Hot Pot, but were told that if cooked too long, it would become salty, so they suggested we order Eggplant and Beef Shank Hot Pot instead.

  Unfortunately, the dishes arrived, and the broth flavors were very bland with no unique taste. The Mala Hot Pot was not spicy or fragrant, the Sichuan Peppercorn Chicken Hot Pot had no pepper flavor, the recommended dish was not liked by everyone, and nobody wanted to eat the leftover ingredients. Eventually, it was put into the spicy hot pot, which was the only one that people ate.

   The food materials were very good quality, but the broth's taste was very poor. A waste of fresh seafood and meat.

  In addition, the service was extremely poor, with employee training issues. We brought our own alcohol and asked them to provide an ice bucket, but they only placed it on the table without putting it in an ice bucket holder, causing water to spill all over the table.

   Although there is a service bell in the booth, you have to press it several times before someone comes to serve you. It took quite some time for someone to come and serve us.

  The restaurant claims that singing is allowed while eating hot pot, but the sound quality was very poor, and the microphone sound was too low, resulting in a poor overall singing experience, unlike KTV, which has song lyrics as prompts. If you want to eat and sing at the same time, I would still suggest going to a hot pot restaurant first and then going to KTV.

  Moreover, there is a very strange thing, the self-service sauce bar, where each person must pay 35 yuan, even though we ordered an eight-person set menu, so including this fee, it was not a cheap hot pot restaurant. The self-service area also provided rice, three side dishes (pickled vegetables, mushrooms, and fruit salad with lychee), fruits such as watermelon and pineapple.

  Finally, the bathroom is outside, which makes going to the restroom during rainy weather very inconvenient.

   In summary, this is a restaurant that I won't visit again after just one visit.",0.05,0.11,0.85,-0.99,負向情感,11.73,882825f833b8f81905e4db93342c81c81a7e2ecc42a259f5a316a042d3559816

非常不錯，告別其他火鍋清一色中式內裝的老套，湊湊走夜店風。非常賞心悅目。而且還有價廉物美的奶茶可以點！才50元（我記得上海是人民幣8元）服務非常好👍帶位的先生跟服務台的妹妹非常和善可愛。我瞄到有暢吃卡有便宜很多，問了一下原來是只要999元可以送3000元的回饋，然後每道菜便宜數十甚至100-200以上的優惠….，對我這種忠實粉絲，當然馬上辦了一張

2. 茶米茶
這個吧台非常高級，但是價位一樣平易近人，我點的是最便宜的滿園紅茶，一樣可口。辦卡贈送的烏龍奶茶也很很不錯

3.水果調料自助吧
有三種水果：西瓜、火龍果、柳橙。三項小菜：醃瓜、海菜、牛肚（？）然後還有現在貴到爆炸的香菜！（連魷魚羹都不加了）暢吃，實現香菜自由啊。

4.A5頂級雪花和牛
這個也是辦卡幾乎不到對折買的，超划算！可惜只有一份，而且到月底為止（真幸運啊）。不在日本也能吃到A5和牛，好吃到流淚啊😭

5.鴨血豆腐
暢吃到飽！好久沒有這樣大口吃滷豆腐了，加了三四次吧，店家非常大方還一直問要不要續。

6. 成都老痲火鍋/番茄牛膝火鍋
這個是我最愛的搭配，一般我不喝火鍋湯（第一太辣、再來怕普林、油脂）但是番茄牛骨例外，在上海是喝台式麻辣，現在回台灣則喝成都老痲火鍋⋯⋯店員一直警告⚠️非常辣，不過說實話，我覺得一點都不辣呀。

7.三拼牛魔王
份量尚可，有三種（牛背肩、牛胸腹、牛小排）自然是牛小排最好吃啦，其他的就還可以。兩個人來說份量一般，加點一份肉肉我覺得才會剛好。

整體來說，缺點是沒有王子麵的選項（老闆不要打我，我承認在上海時都偷偷帶進去吃 嘻嘻😁）其他沒什麼好挑剔的，尤其現在會員還有很大的折扣，趕緊多撈點本。最後歡迎湊湊跟我一樣回來台灣呀！開心😃

後記：咦看評論好評有送東西？我雖然什麼都沒送，不過我是自願推薦這間跟我好幾年的好店給朋友的呦",5 個月前,"1. Atmosphere and Service
Very good, breaking away from the usual Chinese-style decor of hot pot restaurants, Zhum Zhum has a lounge-style feel. Very stylish and pleasing to the eye. And there are affordable milk teas available! Only 50 yuan (I remember Shanghai was RMB 8) The service is very good, the waiter and staff at the counter were very friendly and kind. I noticed there were all-you-can-eat cards and many discounts, when asked, it turned out that for 999 yuan, you could get a refund of 3000 yuan, and each dish has discounts of tens to hundreds of yuan... For me, as a loyal fan, I naturally took action.

2. Tea/Milk Tea
Very high-end, but the price is also very reasonable, I ordered the cheapest rose tea, it was delicious. The black milk tea given with the card is also very good.

3. Fruit and Side Dish Buffet
There are three types of fruit: watermelon, longan, and tangerine. Three small dishes: pickled radish, seaweed, and beef tripe. And now there is a popular price for aromatic herbs! (Even hot pot doesn't add it) It was delicious, realizing the joy of freely enjoying aromatic herbs.

4. A5 top-grade snowflake beef and cow
This is almost not discounted when you buy the card, it's really cost-effective! Unfortunately, there's only one serving, and it will run out by the end of the month (such good luck). Eating A5 beef in Taiwan without going to Japan, it's so delicious that I cried.

5. Duck blood tofu
I ate until I was full! It's been a long time since I ate so much stewed tofu, and the shop keeps asking if you want more.

6. Sichuan Old Crippled Hot Pot/Spicy Tomato Beef Shank Hot Pot
This is my favorite combination, generally I don't drink hot pot soup (it's too spicy, I'm afraid of peppers and oil), but spicy tomato beef shank is an exception. In Shanghai it was drunk with Taiwanese numbing, now it is drunk with Sichuan Old Crippled Hot Pot.... The staff constantly warned ⚠️ It's very spicy, but to be honest, I think it's not spicy at all.

7. Three Pieces of Cow Demon King
The portion size is acceptable, there are three types (cow shoulder, cow chest, cow tenderloin) naturally the tenderloin is the best tasting one, the others can also be eaten. Two people coming say the portion size is generally okay, adding a plate of meat to me feels just right.

In summary, the disadvantage is that there is no option for King's Noodles (don't scold me boss, I admit that in Shanghai I used to secretly bring it in to eat 😊) Other than that, there's not much to complain about, especially now with membership there are large discounts, hurry and take advantage of it. Finally, welcome Zhum Zhum like me to come back to Taiwan! Happy.

PS: Oh, I see there are reviews giving out gifts? Although I didn't send anything, but I voluntarily recommend this store that I have been good friends with for several years to my friends. 😊",0.21,0.04,0.75,1.0,正向情感,13.85,53af989e245d4fc102d6af4a451401cbc9d056f850379d831ea96a207f8bf6f5

喝了之後覺得怎麼那麼好喝！
之後便想到就會喝難以自拔😚
幸好它後來在新莊開分店囉！

個人喜歡茶味很重的，不喜歡太奶的飲料😆
這家的茶很茶，跟奶融合也很順
重點是配料也不馬虎，除了有白玉珍珠還有夕燒珍珠，更提供混珠選項讓咀嚼系充份滿足！

👾白玉珍珠有蜂蜜味，夕燒珍珠則是黑糖味

1️⃣玄米拿鐵+混珠 70
玄米拿鐵是那位珍珠奶茶大使朋友的愛，今天也來試試
玄米茶的味道突出，跟奶融合滑順，這次搭配有玄米-蜂蜜-黑糖的味道，珍珠的表現優秀，選了混珠有點小後悔，覺得選白玉可以更加凸顯整杯茶的味道，但整體而言還是很不錯的🥳

2️⃣烏瓦拿鐵+ 白玉 75
這也是個人很常點的品項，烏瓦紅茶帶著本身的特殊香氣，加上蜂蜜的白玉珍珠，整個搭配只有兩個字：「舒服！」

更多食記分享：IG: bella_food4life",2 年前,"A friend recommended this shop to me when I rarely drank beverages one time I went to Taoyuan. After drinking it, I thought it was so delicious! Unfortunately, I couldn't resist coming back for more later 😅
Luckily, the shop opened a branch in Xinbei eventually!
Personally, I prefer drinks with strong tea flavor and don't like those that are too milky. This shop's tea is very tea-like and blends well with milk. The most notable point is that the toppings are not lackadaisical. In addition to white pearl, there are tapioca pearls and a mixed pearl option to satisfy chewers!

White pearl has honey flavor, while black pearl has brown sugar flavor

1️⃣ Iron Buddha + Mixed Pearls 70
Iron Buddha tea is the favorite of this pearl milk tea friend. Today, I tried it
The taste of Iron Buddha tea stands out, and it blends smoothly with milk. This time, it comes with an Iron Buddha - honey - brown sugar flavor, the white pearls were excellent, but I regretted a bit for choosing mixed pearls instead of white pearl as it could have better showcased the entire tea's taste. However, overall it was still very good! 🥳

2️⃣ Black Sugar Boba + White Pearls 75
This is also one of my favorite items, black sugar boba has its own unique aroma, combined with honey-flavored white pearls, the entire combination can only be described as ""comfortable!""

Food: 4.5/5
Environment: 4/5
Revisit rate: 4.5/5

I think the decor of the shop is quite Japanese, and all drinks are thoughtfully prepared. Whether you're a chewer or not, you can find something suitable for yourself here. Today the weather was good, so I bought myself a drink if I pass by! ☀️

The male employee directly replied: The lemon mousse is Dacquoise, and the order assistant thought, well, you keep saying it like that. What else can you say? Upon delivery of the food items, I couldn't tell if there was a lack of drinks, but the snacks were either missing or inappropriate, my lemon mousse did not resemble what I had imagined at all, as the two pieces contained filling, which I had never seen with a lemon mousse before. The employee said: The items have two names, both are called lemon mousse. Strange, why do they need two names for the same item? Since there was a lack of delivery, I again contacted to send a supplement, and also repeated our concerns about the lemon mousse, clarifying our questions once more. Upon arrival, it was as we had imagined the lemon mousse.

Personally, I believe that the staff at this store are not clear about their items, and are hard-headed, failing to ask other colleagues for assistance, so there is a need for further training and education.

說實在的在新莊幸福路上手搖飲店家本來就是一級戰區，在這邊工作兩年多就看過很多手搖飲店家的招牌，拆了又換換了也又拆，來來去去不知道換了多少店家，此路段又算是新莊這區的蛋黃商圈，比來比去就換了又換，有主打的話題店家都不一定能生存，沒有特殊的主打自然無法在這邊生存下去，畢竟這邊租金也隨地段嚇嚇叫，此店家開一陣了，店家主要分類如圖：輕焙，中焙，重焙，等等.首次主買:

💫 金屋厚茶 /L45元

💫 春花青茶 /L40元

這兩款分別歸屬中焙與輕焙，💫 金屋厚茶 茶的厚度如其名夠厚，個人算是喜歡的，青茶是個人在手搖飲店中最常購買，也認為這是一個店家的基本工，如果都一直強調店家主打特色，卻在青茶或綠茶保持不住穩定，那個人覺得很快出局，另外一種類型店家就是基本工有保持，主打也一直換一直宣傳，個人覺得這樣店家的多元化才被看見，也才能在廣廣市場中生存，其實已店家的訂價並不算便宜海海中的存在者，但是店家已可寄杯方式為其運動之一，厲害，像超商買咖啡可寄杯又划算點的概念，顧回流客的概念，再者個人一次買兩杯也是店家實在厲害...買兩杯直接送個環保袋，購買塑膠提袋收費是政府政策，但直接買兩杯就送環保袋這作法可厲害，當然環保袋成本不會比塑膠袋低，卻可以在提倡環保之下又讓顧客想一次帶兩杯提著走，不得的佩服店家用心，看店家掛的招牌如圖，最貴的85，重焙區反而是二訪想買的品項，也如其名💫山焙 以其實入其名，茶味夠，個人喜歡，
💫 五星推薦，而且服務親切，謝謝招待，祝生意興隆，好久沒這麼長篇文...🌍2024/05",8 個月前,"mountain baked (Sunbay Happiness Store)

Honestly, on Sunbay Happiness Road, the milk tea shop has always been a frontline area. Working here for more than two years, I have seen many milk tea shop owners change their signs, dismantle and rebuild, coming and going without knowing how many have changed. This section of the road is also known as New Taipei City's Egg Yolk District, where shops come and go frequently, with trendy topics changing constantly. A shop cannot survive without a unique specialty, and if a shop cannot maintain consistency in green tea or oolong tea, it will quickly go out of business. Another type of shop is one that maintains basic operations and continually changes its featured items. I think these shops become more visible and can survive in the crowded market this way. Actually, the prices here are not cheap compared to other existing stores, but the shop offers a service for customers to deliver cups, which is great, like the concept of coffee delivery with a reasonable fee, catering to repeat customers, and another thing, buying two cups directly sends a reusable bag, avoiding plastic bags with a fee. This practice is also great...Buying two cups directly gets a reusable bag, although the cost of a reusable bag will not be lower than that of a plastic bag, but it allows customers to carry two cups while promoting environmental protection at the same time, which deserves respect for the shop's heart. Looking at the sign on the store as shown in the picture, the most expensive item is 85, and surprisingly, the heavier tea category is more popular among repeat visitors, just as its name suggests (💫 mountain baked). With its authentic taste, I personally like it... Five-star recommended, and the service is also friendly. Thank you for your hospitality, I wish the business thrives.

The staff had an unpleasant attitude and only said it would cost $20. It was not worth it, then I asked again why it was more expensive compared to a cheaper option? The staff still had an unpleasant attitude, replying that if there is no pearl, it will be $20. After listening to this, I asked again why there is a price difference without the pearl.
Finally, the staff said because the proportion of fresh milk is different.
In fact, you mentioned from the start that the proportions are different, or suggested that ordering black sugar fresh milk tea would be cheaper, but there was none. The staff's attitude was not good, and I complained about the issue to the manager as I left, feeling disrespected. This is not a good feeling towards customers. Although I don't often buy your fresh milk frequently, I don't understand your pricing for adding or not adding milk. Overall, the buying process wasn't very comfortable. Adding to that, I heard the staff complaining about my question. At that moment, I was extremely unhappy, but since I had already ordered and made the purchase, I left the shop. Staff can please be more considerate when talking and understand customer needs before responding. If they are not satisfied, they can suggest buying from another shop instead which is fine too!

I absolutely adore this flavor, especially on cold days when I want a cup of can-can. I also recommend their black sugar pearls fresh milk tea, which is another one of their signature drinks. The QQ texture of the black sugar pearls is delicious and has just the right chewiness. Compared to regular pearl milk tea, I prefer the pure fresh milk drink, as it uses fresh milk directly without any preparation, perfect for those who love chewing.""",0.29,0.04,0.67,0.99,正向情感,7.23,32914b2dbb753f58ce2686c7d2a1d272279262eb5bea8ce52da98a5576d44627

我是一位很愛您們家飲料的客人，而我正在練習「減塑、減少一次性垃圾」。

今天特別帶了兩個環保杯去買珍珠歐蕾。
店員非常客氣地以「杯子太小裝不下」拒絕前去購買的家人。
家人有向店員表示：「多的倒掉、或是我們自己喝掉沒關係。」
客氣店員則表示「這樣比例會不對。蓋子蓋上去會滿出來～」

於是家人失望地帶回兩杯外帶杯+兩個環保杯。
後來經測試，是裝的下的唷～！！

The family explained ""we can pour more or drink it ourselves,""

So, the family disappointedly took back two cups with lids + two reusable cups.
Later on, it was found out that it could fit after all!~!!

The beverages are still delicious. The most frequently consumed lychee red tea is sour-sweet with a tea aroma, it's addictive to drink one after another (other brands have strong flavors).
Nowadays, the rare and once popular strawberry smoothie, which contains lychee, lemon, and milk, has a beautiful pink color. It tastes sour-sweet and also creamy, and it's particularly good to drink.

查了一下官網資料，龜記濃乳茶使用了嚴選台茶18號紅玉、肯亞紅茶及斯里蘭卡三種茶葉烘培出獨特木質香氣，果然茶香不會被鮮乳奶搶走！被搶走的是年輕店員們的服務心態XDDD，不過感覺台灣手搖飲服務業早就不走服務至上路線了啊，所以對於年輕店員們的服務熱忱我是保持著極大的包容心，不能和超商二度就業的親切大媽們比XD，沒辦法吃人嘴軟！我很怕這間沒了又要再尋尋覓覓茶味夠濃的鮮奶茶…... 加油！請保持下去，這一帶手搖飲競爭超激烈…

今天N訪時，離開時有店員們說謝謝嚇到我！！服務突然有變很親民，或者是因為和之前不同店員？XDD。 平衡報導：其實在我看來, 各家年輕店員態度都大同小異~~ 大家的冷表情全都一樣，也許只差在語調或互動應對。

另外發現最近很多家都流行 “外帶環保杯” 的人要 “自己把蓋子打開自己蓋好“，店員只負責拿杯子，我覺得擔心的是風險耶~好怕手殘打翻當場要自己再賠一杯吧~T_T~ 尤其點餐出餐共用檯子的空間很小，但清楚這是品牌業主的教育SOP流程要求，而且其它家也都這樣要求，實在很好奇不知道這訴求的用意和好處是什麼 @@...

I was recommended ""Tortoise Cream Tea"" by the staff, which initially scared me because the name seemed to suggest it would be creamy. Fortunately, Tortoise Cream Tea turned out to have a strong tea flavor, and it belongs to the thick tea category that I prefer.

I found out that Tortoise Cream Tea is made with carefully selected Taiwanese Oolong 18 Red Jade, Kenyan Red Tea, and Sri Lankan teas baked to create a unique woody aroma. The tea aroma does not get overpowered by the fresh milk.

However, I was worried that this shop might close down again and leave me searching for another strong milk tea... Keep going! This area has an extremely intense competition in the beverage industry...

Today, when I visited N store, the staff thanked me as I left! Their service suddenly became very friendly, or maybe it was because I interacted with a different staff member? XDDD. In balanced reporting: Actually, in my opinion, all the young staff members have similar attitudes... Everyone's cold expression is quite alike; perhaps there are differences in tone or interaction responses.

I also found that many shops are popularizing ""reusable cups"" these days, and customers have to ""open the lid and put it back on themselves."" The staff only handles the cup, but I worry about the safety risk of a spill! Especially since the space for placing the tray and dining area is quite small. However, it seems that this is a part of the brand owner's educational SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), and other shops also require the same, which makes me curious as to what the purpose and benefits are...

The one-star reviews were quite helpful, I wish I had noticed earlier. Since it fits my taste, I used to frequently buy from there before, almost every day, now that I have moved, I will still drop by occasionally. Recently they added soups, seems okay, can solve the issue of hunger at once. Today I felt the shop's ruthlessness and decided to ignore it. Bought a loaf of bread next door or a cake from the store across instead, drank some soda next door or tea across. Where is one plus one now?

   The points activity has been discontinued, but was there an announcement? Did all customers receive notice? The staff may not specifically emphasize or remind of this change, and the notification only appeared later that day because I had two phones with 8/9 battery. So, please allow me to buy three cups to supplement points for now, but you declined, then asked if it was still possible to exchange twice with the current number of points? They seem quite principled

   Business is about profits, not politics. Giving a customer $35 at 5 pm to let them come back and buy drinks+soups again seems okay, but won't it be bad if they keep coming back again and again for more drinks+soups? Besides, I will still have to pay the difference even when I exchange.

The entire shop had four employees, but only one was making drinks. I was the third group of customers, and it took me 10 minutes to serve me even though there were only two groups in front of me.
What made me angry was not just that the employee's hands and feet were slow and I had to wait for a long time, but also that an online order (4 cups of pure tea) was inserted in the queue, which meant that she served 8 drinks to me in 10 minutes.
The most infuriating thing was that she gave the drink to number 22 before me, even though I was number 21! I couldn't help but question the employee, and she answered me that my KKL takes a longer time to mix! Even though it was my first day buying KKL, of course I knew it had to be mixed, but it took more than 3 minutes for her to make it, which seems too long. Other shops can serve drinks in a minute or less. Isn't it possible that I could mix faster than she did?
I know that the drink shop employees are busy and hardworking, especially since 50 RMB tea shops always have good business, but this speed of serving drinks is already so slow as to be ridiculous. If the employee was not familiar with the drinks at least two people capable of making drinks should be stationed outside, right? Eating food is just eating food and adding pearls....

對於店員用心製作出的奶蓋，甚至賦予生命，非常感謝也很感動，杯蓋本身設計不完善或是製造品質上有公差我知道並不是門市問題，但門市在一道一道製作流程中，能夠多加留心是否達到出杯標準，若無法密合及時給予更換是會更好的。

飲用上唯一美中不足是口隆起的塑膠是沙沙的，有磨損過的感覺，可能是有掉過地上或是不知道如何造成的，以前沒有體驗過的口感，希望門市能多加留意這點。

Regarding the milk lid carefully crafted by the store staff, even given life, I am very grateful and touched. However, the design of the lid itself is not perfect or there are quality issues. Although I understand that this is not a problem with the store, the store could show more care in the manufacturing process to ensure it meets the standard of a cup lid. If it cannot be assembled neatly and on time, prompt replacement should be provided.

The only flaw in using the lid is that the plastic mouthpiece feels gritty, giving a worn-out sensation, possibly due to falling or improper manufacture. I have not experienced this texture before. I hope the store could pay more attention to this point.

In short, I merely hope to express my opinion constructively so the company can make improvements. The drink itself is fine, and the milk lid remains delicious, so I will still give it 5 stars.",0.15,0.04,0.81,0.98,正向情感,9.52,0c7d2b6656d41e42f7ca99dead0fd52617a292a0334106ae1a59aa771bd370dc

  High Mountain Qing did not disappoint being the signature! It has a light floral aroma with a gentle sweet aftertaste, yet the price is surprisingly reasonable.

The ""La Lai Tea Stack"" located on Banshugang Road in Banqiao, emanating brilliant angelic radiance that drew me in to spend, despite never having been there before.

I ordered a cup of ""Empress Milk Tea"" lightly sweetened and iced, which was essentially red tea with milk. The combination of tea and milk flavors blended perfectly, providing great satisfaction in this scorching weather. As I drank and browsed the internet about La Lai's history: La Lai Tea Stack was founded by Mr. Lai Cheng-Mo who initially sold fruit in the market, but started selling red tea on the side for his own consumption. To his surprise, the red tea business flourished.

This consumption is 7 cups (beverage + ping-pong balls turned into pearls, however, the texture of the pearls wasn't good; the mango four seasons tasted like just chunks of mango dropped into tea, adding a bit of mango juice might improve the texture, there was a small bug in one cup of mango four seasons.)

凍類還更有嚼勁一點，重點是量不會給很少，不像烏弄沒兩下就吸光光，徒留一杯空茶…

雙揪哩就是檸凍+梅凍，咀嚼系很可以！果茶部分喝過芭樂檸檬跟鳳梨青茶，個人比較喜歡前者，鳳梨我覺得鳳梨果肉沒那麼多（個人熱愛鳳梨），但不是醃鳳梨這點又很不錯（很多都是用鳳梨醬調的）。

Table tennis is made with tapioca pearls, but unlike some other shops' winter versions that can be too hard, I think it has the perfect texture, my mouth doesn't get too sour but also doesn't lack flavor.

Ice-type drinks have a bit more chewiness, and the portions are just right, not like some places that run out quickly, leaving only an empty cup of tea...

The mixed ice (lemon + plum) is very enjoyable! I've had bubble milk tea with strawberry lemon and pineapple green tea before, and I prefer the former.

📍 Riding along Zhongshan Road, when you turn into Xinmin Street, you will see this shop. When I arrived, there were already many people lining up inside, but the queue was bearable, so I decided to wait for a bit. I estimated that there were five employees working in the shop.

I ordered my drink with little sugar and little ice, but actually, it could be enjoyed without sugar to taste the delicate tea aroma even better.

It's worth praising the waitress on duty that day 😊
Because I saw steamed rice cakes,

As I don't drink sweet drinks much, I can taste the tea flavor even without sugar.

I didn't know what to order, so I asked the staff for recommendations
Finally, they recommended ""Millet King Steamed Rice Cake with Ginger""
At first, I was worried that it wouldn't have any flavor if there was no sugar,
but the staff told me ""The steamed rice cake has a slightly sweet taste, so not adding sugar won't be odd.""
So I added a little sugar and wanted to enhance the tea flavor.

❣️地點偏遠：離捷運站很遠，要騎車或者開車才能到達。

❣️餐點：季節性飲品，例如：芒果或草莓口味白木耳飲，口感很優質❗️
熱量很低且成分單純，可選擇低糖或無糖。

❣️個人喜愛：無糖雪耳飲
我一次都是買好幾罐雪耳飲，回家搭配牛奶一起食用，有吃燕窩燉奶的感覺😋

❣️服務：板橋分店的店員介紹得很詳細，可惜沒有提供試喝服務🥲

❣️個人建議：
1.全台分店只有兩間，兩間都離捷運站很遠。建議從官網預訂宅配到府👍
2.原味白木耳飲(含糖版）口感比較單純，建議選擇奶茶口味或者其他水果口味。

4. Personal preference: Sugar-free ear fun drink
I always buy several cans of it, enjoy it at home with milk, having a feel similar to eating egg tarts with hot milk 😊
5. Service: The staff at the Banqiao branch are very detailed in their introductions, unfortunately, no tasting service is provided 🥲
6. Personal recommendation:
   a. Both stores are located far from MRT stations, it is suggested to order delivery through the website 👍
   b. The original white ear fun drink (with sugar) has a simpler taste, it's recommended to choose milk tea flavor or other fruit flavors.

I do not know whether the abnormal addition of ice in the fresh orange jade on that day was according to the instructions from the headquarters or a decision made collectively by the franchise stores to save costs. However, your store during the activity did ignore customer requests and decided the drink ice level on its own, without informing customers about the need to reduce ice for the promotion before purchasing, which seems like deceptive marketing towards consumers. Since you dare to do this on the day of the activity, you should also have the courage to face criticism. Why does it seem now that the store is the victim? Your skin is thicker than an armor plated steel panel. There are many beverage stores around, so I will definitely inform my friends, colleagues, and acquaintances not to waste their time going there.

所有的飲料單價以中杯、大杯來說跟其他品牌比較來看，不便宜也不貴，在中價位。
這次我點阿薩姆鮮奶茶65元，無糖去冰、茉香綠茶35元，無糖去冰。

The price of all drinks, considering the medium and large sizes compared to other brands, is not cheap or expensive, it's in the mid-price range. This time I ordered an original fresh Asam milk tea for 65 yuan without sugar and ice, and a green tea with mint for 35 yuan without sugar and ice.

在電話過程中，女性店員態度不是很好，在電話開頭就有先詢問活動了，如果活動是買五送一，當下點了11杯不應該跟消費者告知可以再多點一杯嗎？店員是直到送到我這之後才說：「喔因為你點11杯所以只送1杯，你應該要點6的倍數才有送喔。」

I wasn't calculating the cost of that extra cup, it was more about the principle. If they had informed me during the call that I could add another cup, I would have ordered another cup of tea and been happy, rather than finding out at the end.

因為喝過別家可可鮮奶無糖是不會甜的，復刻拿鐵是茶拿鐵，無糖更不可能甜到像半糖或全糖那麼甜。如果真的原本茶底或巧克力粉就有帶糖會甜，別家都會在外送品項上寫提示，告知消費者品項無糖也會是甜的。但你們完全沒有！原本很期待喝你們飲料，現在真的很難過，想說可可那麼甜沒關係，那我喝另一杯拿鐵就好，結果另一杯比可可拿鐵還甜，整個甜到哭，心情變好差

Whether you drink it simply or pair it with pastries, it is an excellent choice.

Apparently your shop knows this batch of sugar beet is so bland that it needs additional sugar to have any flavor...yet you still decided to stock it for customers to choose? That must have been tedious! I would rather not add extra sugar, but I was advised to do so.
By the way, why does green tea need to be sweet? Isn't it possible to drink unsweetened green tea? (I have had a lot of sugar beet green tea and have encountered many times when the flavor is bland, but at least there should be some tea taste, right?)
Moreover, I was just asking if the tea taste needs to be present. It's like asking whether food tastes good with or without salt. Let me feel a bit lost, as I am not requiring the tea flavor to be strong.
If your products do not meet your usual standards, you still decide to stock them, that must have been tedious! Customers may react poorly, and your shop will have to bear the risk!
Your shop may have other strong products that I haven't tried, but I am only commenting on this unsweetened sugar beet green tea. Maybe adding sugar would make it taste better? I hope your business thrives!

前陣子偶然發現這裡開了家非連鎖飲料店  雖有興趣  但店名讓我沒有想立馬拜訪的衝動  加上  看到價位也是中間偏高  興致降低不少  因為朋友難得來南崁一趟對這家店有興趣  才陪同一起試試  沒想到覺得還不錯

第一次嘗試的品項是慕木紅茶  特點是木質調香氣  個人喝了印象滿好的  茶味夠、也不會太稀  倒是第二次嘗試的貴妃紅玉覺得比較沒特色  下次是該試試店家招牌—「泡沫紅茶」了

他們家珍珠滿好吃的  立馬吃的口感咬勁十分足夠  也不會太甜  有推😋
一般飲料店珍珠放冰箱過夜  隔天一定是黏成一坨  糾結的不再是粒粒分明的狀態  而且整個裡面硬掉、外面軟掉糊掉
但是他們家珍珠一樣條件下  珍珠隔天居然還可以是粒粒分明  而且還有正常的Q度（當時的情況是喝到剩一些）
為了確認真實性  又再買了兩次同樣是加珍珠的品項  確實冰到隔天早上還不太會糾結  不過大約24小時後就開始會輕微黏結在一起  除非沒有飲料  黏結情形才會加劇  至於咬勁都還是有在  不會裡面有硬硬的澱粉感或太軟爛的情形  覺得算是表現十分優秀的珍珠👍
加珍珠不加價  有大小珍珠可選

雖命名為復古意象  但裝潢還是可看出為現代簡約設計  店內尚有附設簡約的內用座位區

至於第一次拜訪有個難忘的經驗
問店員（一位好似為外籍工作者，男性）招牌的泡沫紅茶為什麼樣的風味  他竟然說他也不知道😂
因為怕只是很普通的古早味紅茶  所以就一直沒點該品項了",1 年前,"2023.06.24
I recently stumbled upon a new tea shop here, though it piqued my interest, the name didn't prompt me to rush in immediately due to its high pricing and lack of distinctive appeal. However, since a friend was interested, I joined them for a try. To my surprise, it wasn't bad.

The first item I tried was Mugo Red Tea with woody aroma, which left a good impression on me. The tea flavor was rich yet not overpowering. Unfortunately, the second item I tried, the Noble Jade Oolong, lacked distinctiveness. Next time, I will try their signature— ""Foam Red Tea.""

Their pearls are delicious and have a perfect bite. They're not too sweet and just chewy enough. A smiley emoji (😋) for the push.
Usually, pearls kept overnight in the refrigerator become sticky and clump together by the next day. However, their pearls remain distinct even after being stored overnight, and they still have a good quality. To confirm authenticity, I bought two more similar items with pearls. As expected, the pearls don't get too hard or too soft, and there is no chalky sensation. I think it's an impressive pearl selection (👍)
The price for adding pearls remains the same, and they offer both large and small pearls to choose from

Though named as retro, the design is modern and minimalist. The interior still has a minimalist seating area for customers.

There was an unforgettable experience during my first visit when I asked the staff (a man who seemed like a foreign worker) about the distinctive flavor of their signature foam red tea. To my surprise, he said he didn't know (😂). Since it might have been just an ordinary old-style red tea, I decided not to order that item ever since.

點了半糖結果一喝很像奶水，根本沒有鮮奶和糖的味道，喝了不到五分鐘馬上拉肚子，一杯59塊的飲料這種品質我也不好說什麼，看底下的留言大部分的人都喝到自己喜愛的飲料、沒什麼問題，所以可能不是每次都這樣，就事論事只覺得自己拿到跟別人不一樣品質的飲料很衰！

在軍中當兵難得叫外送還喝到這樣的飲料，哎喝不到一口就全倒了（點了半糖喝起來像無糖，滿滿的奶粉水味，還可以讓人拉肚子，真的不敢恭維）….希望下次不會有人跟我喝到一樣品質的飲料

 I clicked on the half-sweet option, but when I drank it, it tasted very much like milk, with almost no taste of fresh milk or sweetness. I felt nauseous less than five minutes after drinking it. The drink cost 59 yuan, and its quality was poor. Most of the people in the comments seemed to have enjoyed their drinks without any problems, so maybe not every time is like this, but I still feel disappointed that I received a different quality of drink from others...

In the army, it's hard to get takeout, and yet I ended up drinking this kind of drink. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish one sip (I clicked on half-sweet, but it tasted like no sugar, with a full taste of powdered milk water, and it could still make you feel nauseous, really not daring to praise). ... I hope there won't be anyone who gives me drinks of the same quality in the future

 Just now I drank another cup ordered by my comrade, but everyone seemed to drink normally, and it was quite delicious (to be honest), maybe the staff forgot to add sugar, then I clicked on medium ice, the ice cubes were too few, resulting in the whole drink tasting like water without flavor!

In the competitive beverage market [Nanxi road],
Unique products can add many more memories for customers~~ I suggest choosing 1 sugar or sugar-free option because the tea itself already has sweetness.

It's not almond, it's made with tea by the store,
I will try it next time

我真的頭很痛 我已經打字說過也電話說過「我們有下樓也有等候 但你們沒有在地址的位置 而是在外面所以根本沒看到人」
那為什麼結論會是「我們不願意下樓」？
互相退一步 我們下樓沒看到人 所以你們連一次上樓都不願意 就因為你們說「很有誠意送來了」所以我們不要當刁難人的奧客應該活該再下樓第二次才對嗎
這樣合理？

貼紙根本貼錯 然後你現在跟我說你們沒有做錯 所以另一杯熱的鮮奶烏貼成冰的囉？所以外送員看著貼紙送 所以是外送員送錯囉 你們完全完全沒責任囉？
怎麼到這個地步還在撇清責任
貼紙看一下好嗎 外送員如果今天戴手套 他看著杯上貼紙送 不是天經地義嗎！？
昨天說小姐做錯 我們也下樓一次 死要我們再下次一次 然後卻是我們刁難而不是你們寧願在樓下站著跟我鍵盤手不願意花幾秒送上來表示歉意才叫刁難
而是我們下去一次不願意下去第二次才叫刁難耶？
你這個店長的教育訓練完全沒辦法以身作則耶 員工怎麼學得到好榜樣 昨天完全沒有對我們感到抱歉就算了 留了電話也完全完全沒主動回播任何一次 都是我們顧客在主動聯繫
到底誰不願意好好處理事情
現在還要追根究柢的意義是什麼 討一口氣？覺得自己不是顧客至上的服務態度很驕傲？還是真的覺得自己完全沒有任何疏失？還是要我們跟你道歉？
那很抱歉你真的什麼都得不到以外還顯得自己真的很沒做生意的能力
而且昨天電話已經跳針五次跟你說了貼紙上面是貼熱的但飲料是冰的 然後請問你現在有跟那位uber先生確認是他的疏失才敢來密我這些嗎 我看是沒有吧

那我只能說誰接到你們家的訂單誰就真的是倒大楣了呢！",4 年前,"Your comments have always been incorrectly labeled as ""needles"" ""We have both delivered and waited, but you were not at the specified location, so you didn't see anyone."" Why is the conclusion then ""We do not want to deliver""?
If we hadn't seen anyone upon delivery, why wouldn't you be willing to come up even once? Because you said ""very sincerely delivered it"" should we, the customers, be disrespectful visitors when we should have come down a second time, right? Is this reasonable?
The sticker was clearly placed incorrectly, and now you're saying you didn't make a mistake. So, you expect another hot cup of spoiled milk tea to arrive frozen, right? The delivery person saw the sticker and delivered it, so is it the delivery person who made the mistake, or are you completely without responsibility?
How did we get to this point and still shifting blame? Should I look at the sticker? If a delivery person wore gloves today, wouldn't he be aware that the cup had a label on it containing hot milk tea?
Yesterday, you said it was our fault. We came down once, but should we come down again twice before being considered rude? And yet, instead of your staff expressing any remorse yesterday, they ignored our calls. They only contacted us when we made the effort to reach out. Who is unwilling to handle things properly?
Now you want to go back to the root cause, but is it just to blow off steam? Do you think yourself as a customer-centric service attitude or do you really believe that you have made no mistakes at all? Or do we need to apologize to you?
I'm sorry, but it seems like you can't get anything right except showing a lack of business skills.

240,功夫茶KUNG FU TEA(桃園藝文店),楊大同,5,這家位於桃園市同安街的功夫茶飲料店，是經過朋友介紹推薦的，本身愛喝茶飲品的我，對於茶葉本身的味道很挑剔，所以決定先牛刀小試一下，從最基本的茶飲品便可以知道店家是否如同其名一樣，有一番真功夫在。我點了兩杯：日月潭紅玉紅茶及芒果冰沙外帶回家喝，喝下去的第一口感覺是想大大的給店家一個無敵讚~👍👍👍，我很怕喝到的茶，不管是紅茶還是綠茶大部分的都會有一股澀味，而功夫茶卻沒有，而是有淡淡的紅茶香與真正紅茶的清甜，正是我所喜歡的味道：果真好喝!芒果冰沙也不錯，也不會太甜，冰沙的細膩度很棒，入口即化，芒果味在嘴裡久久不會散去。真的體會到了什麼叫一分錢一分貨，功夫茶的茶飲品是真的有下功夫的，我會再次造訪並推薦這家實在的飲料店給親朋好友一同分享。會不斷嘗試你們家的不同產品，希望你們繼續堅持與打拼，服務人員態度都很客氣親切，茶好喝，人親切，沒有什麼理由不給你們捧場的。好樣的~功夫茶~👍👍👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👏👏👏👏👏,1 年前,"This tea shop located on Zhong An Street in Taoyuan City, which was recommended by a friend, offers a variety of teas.

I ordered two drinks: Tianchi Hongyu Hongcha and Mangguo Bingsha to take home and drink. The first sip was amazing, giving the shop high praise! 👍👍👍 I'm usually wary of teas, but the tea here has a subtle red tea aroma and a genuine sweetness that I love. The mango shaved ice was also not too sweet, with finely shaved ice that melts instantly, leaving a lasting mango flavor on my tongue. It's indeed ""worth its weight in gold."" I will visit again and recommend this authentic tea shop to friends. I look forward to trying more of your products and hope you continue to persist and strive for excellence.

I shook it multiple times before drinking and used the straw to stir it many times, but the boba stuck together just like my abdominal muscles, tightly knitted and unwilling to separate.

Based on my past experience working in beverage shops, this seems to be because it wasn't stirred evenly while cooking. Poking it would cause it to bounce back, indicating that the center is completely compacted.

When preparing the drink, they didn't pick out any of the pearls, allowing customers to consume such a ""dense"" Boba which seems somewhat inappropriate and significantly affects the texture.

The tea aroma was clean and refreshing without bitterness, and the mixed milk cream did not have a layered taste

但是最常喝的還是各家飲品店的底茶

而《功夫茶》的功夫茶王
以阿里山高山茶的頭等獎頭銜標榜
不給加糖也不給加料
直接跟消費者正面對決我覺得很有種今天就來試試看！

🥤功夫茶王（39）
原價60元的茶王現在只要39元
小編從小跟著舅舅喝好茶
所以對於茶品的要求算是挺高的！
除了最基本的無糖要不苦澀
茶的香氣及回甘是一定要有
功夫茶王選用評鑑頭等獎的茶葉製成
每一口喝下去是都非常順口
中韻可以感受到茶的厚實但不苦澀
尾韻則是淡淡的遺香及回甘
我覺變得以39元這價格算是非常超值
值得推薦給喜歡喝純茶的朋友！

🥤寒天柚香飲（55）
到了秋天接近冬季，芒果季漸漸尾聲
各大飲品店也都推出了季節新品
《功夫茶》也不列外
好喝的調味茶底茶可是很重的
一喝下口是清爽的葡萄柚香及甜味
尾韻帶出微微茶香與細微的苦味
整杯喝起來有茶的底蘊及濃度
加上本身沒有味道的寒天晶球增加口感
味道有層次又不會過於複雜
算是一杯接受度頗高的飲品！",3 年前,"🥤 King of Tea (39)
Originally priced at 60 yuan, the King of Tea is now available for 39 yuan. I have been drinking tea with my uncle since I was young, so my requirements for tea are relatively high. Apart from being unsweetened and not bitter, the aroma and aftertaste of the tea are a must. The King of Tea uses top-rated tea leaves to make its tea. Each sip is very smooth, with a rich yet not bitter taste. The aftertaste is subtle and pleasant, leaving a hint of lingering fragrance and sweetness. I think this price of 39 yuan is quite a bargain. I recommend it to friends who enjoy unsweetened teas!

🥤 Cold Winter Tangerine Drink (55)
As autumn approaches winter, the melon season gradually ends
Many beverage stores also introduced their seasonal new products
Functional tea is no exception
A refreshing and sweet flavor of grape and tangerine in a cup of hot tea can be quite heavy

本來是要光顧地圖上的野孩子飲料店  到了現場比對一下位置  嗯  看來是換店家了  只好試試看這間

光顧的時候是晚上十點多  因為是新開的店  所以員工如果手腳慢是可以理解的  但是明明只有兩位客人還等了十多分鐘是⋯⋯⋯？？？？？？  當時有兩位店員  看的出都是新手  一位點單的女生A  一位做飲料的女生B  A有作業上問題問B  B不但手邊做茶的動作「完全」停下來  斯條慢理也抱著不確定的態度幫忙A  完全忽略當下的客人  做飲料也是做的很慢很慢很慢很慢很慢⋯⋯⋯⋯是不知道有客人嗎？  而且客人也才兩位欸  到底是怎麼可以讓人等到十分鐘啊  真的不明白  此時又有第三組客人了  兩位店員還在跟第三組客人抬槓  拜託  我的飲料咧？？？？？有夠誇張  我覺得店家應該要教導這兩位店員  搞清楚事情有輕重緩急、先後順序

邊騎著車回家  邊想著說不定他們家紅茶還不錯喝  結果⋯⋯⋯味道超淡超水  完全不合格

噢  而且這家還有一個奇怪的規定是我喝過這麼多間飲料店從沒遇過的：如果你點大杯「去冰」  店家會跟你明白告知  茶的量就是比較少  會改用500ml（中杯）的杯子裝  如果要維持用大杯子  就要點「少冰」殺小規定  第一次聽說這種  有夠傻眼⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

Originally intended to visit the beverage store for street children on the map, upon arrival, I compared the location and found that it seems a different shop has taken over. I had to try this one.

Giving such a low score to a beverage store for the first time, I thought about it carefully, but there were no advantages at all.

I went at night around 10:30pm because it was newly opened, so it was understandable that the staff might be slow, but clearly only two customers were present and waited more than ten minutes. At the time, there were two employees - a girl A handling orders and a girl B making drinks. Girl A had some issues with her work, and when girl B stopped completely in her tea-making actions to help A, she had an uncertain attitude and helped A while ignoring the current customers. The drink was also made very slowly. It seemed they didn't know there were customers? And with only two customers, it was incomprehensible why they had to wait ten minutes. To my surprise, there were another group of customers at this time, but the two employees were still attending to them. I asked about my drink, but it tasted extremely bland and watery. It was far from acceptable.

Moreover, this shop had an unusual rule that I hadn't encountered in many other beverage shops: if you order a large cup with ""no ice,"" the staff will inform you that the quantity of tea will be less, and they will use a 500ml (medium-sized) cup instead. If you want to keep the large cup, you have to order ""less ice"" and follow this rule. I had never heard of such a thing before - it was truly baffling.

Perhaps it should be renamed ""Dumb Explosion"" or ""Blind Explosion"" more suitable for my experience with this shop. This store leaves a bad impression.",0.08,0.09,0.83,-0.62,負向情感,9.64,bd4e905c5575a368527165bf96ef06284efa380a9c0d45191512ed1d8cc0fd46

Later on, when I wanted to ask the staff about it, I found out that she hadn't even poured the milk foam yet
If today was a case where food needed to be prepared, I would understand
But my drink was ready to serve, why did they skip me directly 🤷🏻‍♀️
This feeling is really bad. If you're going to use numbered cards, why not serve in order? :) :)

Customers can't know your restaurant's service procedures, they only know the order on the numbered card
If your shop doesn't serve drinks based on the numbered card, it would be better not to use them as it could cause confusion :)

But if you do serve in order, normal people who have waited in line wouldn't want to mysteriously skip their turn, right?

I hope your shop can improve the issue of skipping numbers and strengthen staff training ☺

This afternoon around 4:40, I bought three drinks, but the staff didn't respond to me even after calling them two or three times (I'm not sure if it was because I spoke too softly or if they didn't hear me).

She took her time with everything she did, making me wait about 30 seconds before serving me. After placing my order, she was still slow, looking at her phone occasionally, while another one was combing their hair???

今日11點到店購買飲料
選擇的是－－綠茶凍五桐奶茶加珍珠
因使用環保杯，所以店員與我收了65元

回家準備享用前拍了一張照片做記錄
在飲用的過程一直沒有感覺到有茶凍
因此看了杯子，發現店家似乎是漏加了
於是乎去電反映，是一位女性店員接的電話
店家於電話中詢問之後，回應我：我們有加綠茶凍進去

我感到非常錯愕，所以這是指涉客人說謊嗎？
我跟她說我在飲用前剛好有拍張照片，要不我也一併拿過去給你們檢查？
她當下沒有給我任何回應，似乎又在電話那頭與其他人交談
後續似乎也沒有表示要怎麼挽回
我告訴她他們收了我的錢，但是沒有添入應該給我的商品

隨後她說那請你拿回來我們再幫你重做一杯
我說好，然後就掛掉電話

去到現場店員接過我的杯子，問我：所以你這個還要嗎？（指環保杯中喝不到1/3的飲料問)
我說不要了，然後她接過去重新再做了一杯一樣的給我
我問她要不要看看我拍的照片，她不理會我也不曾看向我的方向

當時現場有三個服務人員，其中兩位女性是第一次幫我做飲料的店員
第三位是一個男生，在做好飲料之後由另一個男性店員拿給我
男店員表達了一聲不好意思
我不知道是誰接的電話，但能確定不會是這位男店員

當下我就決定我要客訴與寫這個評論
忙中有錯可以理解，但也請理解客人不會在下雨天要全副武裝穿著雨衣，再騎車過去冤枉你們的錯處。
良善的互動是做生意的根源，祈請您們有所改善，謝謝。

懶得看來龍去脈，可以只看這裡，評論重點有四點：
1.當接到客人反應飲品問題時，第一時間並非致歉而是回頭質疑客人的認知有誤。
2.當下確定是自己做錯了，做錯事情的人還是沒有抱歉的念頭。
3.建議店家在客人使用環保杯時，不要再用一次性紙杯倒過去環保杯中，因為這樣基本是沒有環保到，也可惜了其美意。
4.飲料還是很好喝，謝謝你們製作好喝的飲料，上班辛苦了。",1 年前,"1 star, this drink is good and the apologetic male employee who told me they were sorry
Today at 11am I went to the store to buy a drink
I chose - green tea slush with five-knot milk tea and pearls
Since I used a reusable cup, the employee charged me 65 yuan

Upon returning home, I took a picture before enjoying it as a record
During consumption, I did not feel the presence of the tea slush
Therefore, upon checking the cup, I found that the store seemed to have omitted it
I then called to report, and a female employee answered the phone
The store asked about the situation after questioning, and responded to me: we have added green tea slush in it

I felt very surprised, so is this indicating that the customer lied?
I told her I took a picture before drinking, would you also look at it for me?
She didn't respond to me at all, it seemed like she was talking to someone else on the phone
Later there was no indication of how to rectify the situation
I told her they had taken my money but had not added the necessary items

Subsequently, she said please take it back and we will make a new one for you.
I agreed, then hung up the phone

Upon arriving at the store, the employee took over my reusable cup, asking me: so you still want this? (indicating that only 1/3 of drinkable liquid was in the reusable cup)
I said no, and she took it back to make a new one for me again.
I asked her if she would look at the picture I took, but she ignored me and did not turn towards my direction.

At that time there were three employees on duty, of whom two women were the first to serve me drinks.
The third was a man who made the drink after another male employee had finished preparing it.
The male employee expressed regret
I do not know who answered the phone, but I am sure it was not this male employee.

At that moment, I decided that I would complain and write a review
Errors can happen in the rush of business, but please also understand that customers will not get soaked in the rain, put on raincoats and ride their bikes to falsely accuse you of your mistakes.
Good interactions are the foundation of doing business, I hope there will be improvements, thank you.

Here is the main point of the review:
1.When a customer reports a problem with the drink, the first response should not be to question the customer's perception but to apologize immediately.
2.Even when it is confirmed that it was their mistake, the person who made the error still did not express remorse.
3.I suggest the store not use disposable cups to pour into reusable cups, as this is essentially not environmentally friendly and wasteful of the intention.

When I opened the lid, I found that half of the bottle handle was soaked in drink, absorbing it and leaving a piece of topping on the surface. I was really anxious, not knowing how many bacteria were inside.

You can let me cap it myself. I don't mind. After all, the staff work hard. But since you have helped me cap it, could you pay a little more attention? I am truly angry.

這家店是我第一次來，之前桃園站前有一家cama，但開了約7、8年就收了。很高興看到後站也有cama店出現。不然火車站附近一家cama都沒有，也蠻離譜的。再不振作，都快被路易莎一統江湖了。",2 個月前,"Ordered a cup of camawula hot pearl milk tea, upgraded to thick milk for an additional charge. The taste was rich and aromatic, leaving a lasting impression. In fact, the original camawula pearl milk tea from years ago had this rich flavor, but later it became diluted due to cost-cutting measures and the milk flavor becoming less intense. I hope that camawula will soon return to its initial rich coffee aroma. It's better to charge a premium than to compromise on quality.

   This is my first time here, there used to be a camawula at the Peach Garden station for about 7-8 years but it closed down. I am glad to see that there is now a camawula store at this station.

確認距離、兩通電話的間隔不足5分鐘
12:37不接的那通一路響到無人回應被迫掛斷
但接了友人12:37的電話
好的。就當作是間隔這短短4分鐘的時間
就這麼剛好貴店接了單。讓我的訂單可能無法在約定時間送達
但這也無法迴避你們確實呼攏我距離超過3公里被要求達千元才能外送的回覆
況且我連希望送達時間都根本還沒說到。談何您所回應無法在約定時間送達一事？

不過也不需要你們的服務了
我想喝果汁的時候。我會直接去其他店家消費
畢竟對你們來說我可能是奧客

昨天買過很喜歡。隔天找了大家團訂總額570元想外送
google地圖顯示1.9公里。事先於網路確認過3公里內500元即可外送
打電話至該店提供地址。被告知超過3公里以上需滿額1000元才有外送服務
只好掛上電話後再次確認欲外送的地址是否超出店家的服務範圍
結果就是明明符合標準啊🤷🏻‍♀️

後來再次致電到該店。開始不接電話
請友人幫忙打去之後店家只說因為滿單所以下午三點才會接外送

給人的感受度非常之爛
如果是人力不足/不想出門/嫌金額太低等因素
應該第一時間說明表示真的忙不過來/外面好熱不想騎車等
也不是隨便呼攏說未達門檻吧
或是乾脆全部門檻拉超高。到店家自己覺得可以接受的範圍
不是給了標準也達標又不接外送
那標準訂了有什麼卵用
乾脆外送直接寫依店員當下心情好了👏🏻👏🏻
我們也可以不用這麼白目還一直打電話去吧

   Confirmed that the distance between us and the phone call was less than 5 minutes
   12:37 did not answer the first call, which eventually rang to no response and was forced to disconnect
   However, I answered a call from my friend at 12:37
   Alright. Let's consider this as just the brief 4 minutes of time
   Just then, your store received an order. This may affect the delivery of my order by the agreed-upon time
   However, this cannot be avoided due to your response that distance exceeding more than 3 kilometers would require a fee of over 1000 yuan for delivery
   Besides, I had not even mentioned the desired delivery time. How can you respond that it will not be delivered on time?

   However, I no longer need your services now
   I think I will just go to another store and consume instead
   After all, I may be just a customer for you
   2. Yesterday, I bought something I liked. The next day, I gathered everyone for a group order of 570 yuan with the intention of delivery
   Google Maps showed a distance of 1.9 kilometers. I had confirmed in advance on the internet that if it was within 3 kilometers, delivery would be 500 yuan
   I called the store to provide my address. They said that delivery service is only available for an amount over 1000 yuan if the distance is more than 3 kilometers
   I had to confirm again whether the delivery address was beyond the store's service area after hanging up and trying again
   Result: It turned out to be within the standard, but still not offered delivery service🤷🏻‍♀️

   Later, I called the store again. At first, it did not answer the phone
   My friend helped call later, and the store only said that they were busy and would not accept delivery orders until 3 PM in the afternoon

   The impression given was very poor
   If there were factors such as lack of manpower, unwillingness to go out, or low prices
   These should be explained first. Not calling randomly when the threshold is not met
   Or just set a higher delivery fee from the start. If the store feels it can handle the order within its own range
   It's not fair to meet the standard and then refuse delivery
   The standard for delivery has no use at all
   Just write ""depending on the mood of the employee"" when delivering, instead of constantly calling
   We don't need to keep calling like that, right?

   Customers requiring delivery service please prepare yourself mentally 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",0.05,0.06,0.89,-0.73,負向情感,11.09,70b0afb0529b44ee1ac32eb36ff6ab683cb5d2ece9642b2c1f7e6b07ea6402eb

Because red tea is quite traditional and flavorful, I really like it.
I found that the amount of ice in the first three purchases was too much, so today I changed to buy red tea with less sugar without ice.
I noticed that the server still put some ice cubes in, but since the amount was significantly less than before, I did not mind.
However, when I drank it at home for the first time, I was very disappointed.
The red tea flavor was too faint, like drinking water.
Actually, this would be more difficult to drink than pure water.
I don't know if removing the ice would make the red tea flavor so faint. Or is it just a mistake today?

在日出茶太廣福店消費，
經歷了一場非常遺憾，實覺上被欺瞞的銷售行為。

外帶消費點了兩杯飲料，
一杯是葡萄柚綠茶50元，
另外一杯是四季青茶30元，
合計消費80元。

結帳時櫃台銷售人員，問了一句有會員嗎？
接著說註冊登入會員的話，消費有折扣10元，
然後就引導我掃描櫃檯前的QR Code填寫資料，
等飲料的時間填完資料，順便結帳實收70元折扣10元。

後面來了一組客人點飲料，
兩位女生說有會員但剛好沒有帶手機，
店員就忙著招呼她們解決方式。

此時我發現櫃檯前有一個立牌，
上面寫著即日起各項飲料第二杯五折。
立馬向剛剛的點餐店員反應詢問，
我問說這個第二杯五折的部分是什麼意思？
他回答我就是現在的活動，各種飲料只要第二杯就是五折。
那我問他剛剛叫我登入會員註冊折十塊錢，
跟這個活動比起來哪一個優惠？
他竟然回答我說第二件五折當然比較優惠！

當下傻眼了...
互視數秒後他接著說這次的活動不能二者重覆使用，你可以下一次消費再採用第二件五折。

天啊！！！
這是貴公司教育訓練指導出來的銷售SOP嗎？
櫃台程序上採取讓消費者，使用比較貴的結賬方式買到產品？
店面的所有促銷活動全部都是擺好看的，只要客人沒有留意到，結帳員工就假裝不知道別主動提醒，免得使營業金額下降？
用盡各種話術，就是要讓客人註冊會員得到個資，至於買到貴的銷費金額就算客人自己倒楣了。

臨走前瞄了一下結帳的店員，名牌上掛著的是副店長職務。
期盼貴公司能有稍具誠意的回覆解釋，預祝生意興隆。

At a Cha Tai Guang Fu store, I experienced a very unfortunate incident involving deceptive sales behavior. I purchased two beverages, one was a 50 yuan pear-grape green tea and the other was a 30 yuan four seasons tea, making a total of 80 yuan.

At the cashier, the salesperson asked if I was a member, then mentioned that there would be a 10 yuan discount for members. They then directed me to scan the QR code at the counter and fill out information, which I did while waiting for my drinks. By the time I finished filling in the information, they had already rung up the total to 70 yuan with the 10 yuan discount.

Later, a group of customers ordered drinks, two girls said they were members but happened not to have their phones, so the staff was busy welcoming them and finding solutions for them.

At that moment, I noticed a sign on the counter that read "" starting today, all beverages are half price for the second one."" I asked the server about this second-beverage half-price promotion, and he explained that it was a current activity, where any drink could be bought at half price if it's the second one.

I then asked him why he had asked me to sign up as a member to receive a 10 yuan discount, which seemed less beneficial compared to the half-price promotion. He replied that the half-price offer was more advantageous!

At that moment, I felt shocked... After exchanging a few glances, he then said that the current offer couldn't be combined with the second-beverage offer, and I could use it for my next purchase.

Ah!!! This seems to be a sales SOP from your company's training program? The cashier process encourages customers to pay more for settlement methods in order to buy products? All promotional activities at the store look attractive, but if the customer doesn't notice, the cashier deliberately fails to mention it to avoid reducing sales revenue? Using various tactics, the goal is to get customers to sign up as members and provide personal information, while they take advantage of high sales prices regardless of whether the customer understands or not.

As I was leaving, I noticed that the cashier's name tag read Assistant Manager. I hope your company will offer a more sincere explanation, and wish your business prosperity.

Upon picking up the food, I saw a straw and asked if pearls were added. The male staff member said it was not included in the pearl cost. I placed the drink straw on the counter and continued to use delivery. It is unclear why it could not be served properly or if the food order could be confirmed again to ensure it was correct.

If there is an error in the food at the time of pickup, it should be actively corrected or a compensation plan should be provided.

店員態度是真的和其他網友說的一樣差，
但畢竟人家也只是附近高中、大學來打工的，就不計較了。

但是這個出餐制度有夠詭異：
單號198點了4杯，後面連續4筆單號都是1~2杯，
出餐時由於單號198的飲料店員漏Key了，對不上數量，要補做。
等待過程中，後面連續單號199~201的飲料全都做好了，
就是不出餐，就塞在那邊等單號198。

4個店員，排著隊過來確認198漏做，
又依序確認後面單號都做好了，
然後就回頭繼續做更後面其他單號的飲料。
(然後單號198補做的那杯飲料還排在其他正在做的飲料後面。)

一定要讓店內其他6組客人陪著，
一起等到單號198補做的飲料做完後才要一次性所有餐一起出。
(中間還順帶完成了一單6杯外送單，也一樣不出餐。)

所有人都一起等那杯你們漏Key的飲料。

你們有4個人耶？一個過來出餐消化店內等候人數很困難嗎？
會造成什麼混亂嗎？錢也先付了，飲料也做好了，單號也一一確認無誤了，不出餐的理由是什麼？寧願讓一堆飲料放在檯上陪著滴水等你們？

The attitude of the staff is as bad as what other netizens have said;
However, considering that they are just part-time workers from the nearby high school and university, I'll let it go.

However, this dining system is quite bizarre:
Order number 198 ordered 4 cups, but subsequent order numbers 1 to 2 were also single or double cups. When serving, due to the staff member of order number 198 forgetting the key, there was a mistake in the quantity, and it had to be re-made.
During this time, orders 199 to 201 were prepared but not served, they were just stacked waiting for order number 198.
Four staff members came over to confirm that order number 198 was not made, then confirmed that the subsequent orders were made, and then went back to make the later orders of drinks.
(Later, the drink being re-made for order number 198 was still behind the ones currently being prepared.)

Everyone had to wait for the drink that was forgotten to be re-made;
Even though all other 6 groups of customers were waiting, they could not serve each dish one by one until the drink for order number 198 was ready.
(In between, a takeout order of 6 cups was also completed but still not served.)

Everyone waited for the forgotten drink of order number 198.

Do you have four people? Is it difficult to serve customers inside when one comes out to eat and wait? Will this cause chaos?

309,先喝道(桃園藝文店),林聖庭,1,"從「你訂」平台上點餐，預計時間寫12:40完成，準時到店裡詢問櫃檯小姐飲料是否完成？小姐告知正在做了請稍等，因為午休時間還足夠，所以覺得多等個十五分鐘也沒問題，結果硬生生等了足足五十分鐘，13:30才拿到。

1. 製作飲料的人跟櫃台很像兩家不同店的人，櫃台往裡面喊「你訂」XX號到囉！，製作飲料的人也不回聲，隔了三分鐘又往外面問：「你訂」XX號到了嗎？內外互喊了不下五次確認，各做各的沒有任何一點溝通。

2. 既然都已經先在平台上訂餐了，不就是應該直接開始製作，等到預計時間到，客人到店直接取餐嗎？為什麼還要等到客人現場等了五到十分鐘，才要開始往裡面確認客人到了，可以開始製作了？訂過別家手搖的網路訂餐，沒看過有店家流程是這樣的。

3. 現場訂單跟網路訂單完全搞得亂七八糟，現場訂單跟網路訂單順序排假的，明明號碼比較前面的人，拿到飲料的時間卻比號碼後面的人可以差個十號以上，請問是哪個客人態度比較強勢，就優先跳號製作嗎？現場有個國中生弟弟，我從12:40準時到店就看到他了，結果跟我一樣等了快一小時，看他最後也忍不住去櫃檯詢問，櫃檯才告知要準備開始做你的了？如果只是要當下安撫客人就隨便回答：「開始做你的了」，不如老實說就是忘記了，喊完又繼續忘，感受更差。

從來沒有一次因為店家訂單多、出餐速度慢就生氣留負評，但這次真的氣不過，能體諒店員們態度很好、訂單多出餐累，但製作流程跟應對實在大大有問題，請貴店的店長或主管可以好好審視這個問題，覺得現場遲遲等待的客人脾氣修養都很好，沒有人口出惡言，希望未來若有機會再次消費，能看見貴店改善問題，謝謝。

先喝道飲料是好喝的，但還沒喝到先氣到😤！",5 個月前,"1. The person making the drink and the cashier seem to work in different sections of the same store, with the cashier calling out ""Your order"" XX number and the drink maker not responding. After waiting three minutes, the drink maker called out again: ""Your order"" XX here? There was no response from either side for several minutes, with both sides continuing to confirm repeatedly without any communication.

2. Since the order was already placed online, shouldn't the preparation of the food begin immediately and be ready by the estimated time, with the customer picking up the food upon arrival? Why is it necessary to wait five to ten minutes for the customer to arrive before checking if they have arrived and the preparation can begin? I have never seen an ordering process like this at other restaurants.

3. The in-store order and online order are a mess, with the sequence of orders jumbled. Orders with lower numbers were served before those with higher numbers, although the table numbers indicated the opposite. Is it because the customer with stronger attitudes gets priority for seating? There was a middle school student here since 12:40, and he waited nearly an hour until he finally asked the cashier, who then said they would start preparing his order. If only to pacify the customer, it would have been better to just say that it had already started rather than saying it had been forgotten and then continuing to forget about it, creating a worse impression.

I have never been angry at a restaurant because of too many orders or slow service, but this time I am really frustrated. Although the employees are friendly and the store is busy, there are significant problems with the production process and handling customer complaints. I hope the manager can take a closer look at these issues. The customers who waited patiently despite the delay were very good-tempered, and no one spoke rudely, but I hope that if given another opportunity to patronize your store in the future, we will see improvements in these areas. Thank you.

It's a base for strawberry milk, accompanied by glutinous rice and milk foam. It has a creamy texture and a pleasant taste. Not overly sweet, not too heavy or thick like traditional milk foam.

The milk foam section doesn't have a distinct feeling, possibly mixed in with the drink itself 😂

It tastes like Thai milk tea. Slightly sweet. This one also comes with milk foam. The flavor is rich and creamy. Not bad...

The Jade Dragon is not bitter. No sugar is needed even for single serving... The quantity of osmanthus apple ice cream is sufficient, so it won't be half-drunk without the flavor... The apple taste is more prominent than the osmanthus... Overall, it's not bad.

Went to buy last Saturday afternoon. Saw a notice pulling down at 5:00 to resume selling. Before 5, there were already many customers queuing up. We were among the first five groups of customers.

個人認為如果暫時沒有備料，拿掉有小芋圓的品項會更好，而不是直接更換其它配料。
